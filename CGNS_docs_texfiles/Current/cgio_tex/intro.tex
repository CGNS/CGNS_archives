The CGIO interface provides low-level access to the database manager which
underlies CGNS. The original database manager for CGNS was
\href{../adf/adf.pdf}{ADF} (Advanced Data Format), and as such
much of the CGIO interface routines are patterned after this. Starting
with CGNS library version 2.xx, a new database manager
\href{../hdf5/hdf5.pdf}{HDF5} (Hierarchical Data Format) was
introduced. At that time only one of these database managers could be used
at a time, and this was selected at build time.

In CGNS library version 3.xx, the CGIO interface was developed to support
both database managers simultaneously, and in a fashion transparent to
the application code. This is now the preferred way to acces the database
manager.

This document defines the general structure of a database file, but not
the specific implementation details. See the
\href{../adf/adf.pdf}{ADF} and \href{../hdf5/hdf5.pdf}{HDF5}
Implementations for the details.
The CGIO core routines used to store and retrieve data from the
database manager are also described.
