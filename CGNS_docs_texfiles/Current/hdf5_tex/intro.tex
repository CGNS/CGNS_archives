\section{HDF5 Implementation}
\label{s:hdf5}
\thispagestyle{plain}

This document specifies the exact manner in which, under CGNS
conventions, CFD data structures (the SIDS) are to be stored in, i.e.,
mapped onto, the file structure provided by the HDF database manager.
Adherence to the mapping conventions guarantees uniform meaning
and location of CFD data within HDF files, and thereby allows the
construction of universal software to read and write the data.
