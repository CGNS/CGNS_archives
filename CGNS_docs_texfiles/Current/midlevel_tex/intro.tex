This document outlines a CGNS library designed to ease implementation of
CGNS by providing developers with a collection of handy I/O functions.
Since knowledge of database manager and file structure is not required to use
this library, it greatly facilitates the task of interfacing with CGNS.

The CGNS Mid-Level Library is based on the
\href{../filemap/filemap.pdf}{SIDS File Mapping Manual}.
It allows reading and writing all of the information described in
that manual including grid coordinates, block interfaces, flow
solutions, and boundary conditions.
Use of the mid-level library functions insures efficient
communication between the user application and the internal
representation of the CGNS data.

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the information in the
\href{../sids/sids.pdf}{CGNS Standard Interface Data Structures
(SIDS)}, as well as the
\href{../filemap/filemap.pdf}{SIDS File Mapping Manual}.
The reader is also strongly encouraged to read the
\href{../user/user.pdf}{User's Guide to CGNS}, which contains
coding examples using the Mid-Level Library to write and read simple
files containing CGNS databases.
