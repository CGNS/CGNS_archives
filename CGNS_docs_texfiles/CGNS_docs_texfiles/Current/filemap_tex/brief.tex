\section{Brief Description of CGNS}
\label{s:brief}
\thispagestyle{plain}

The CFD General Notation System (CGNS) is a set of standards, together
with software implementing those standards, for the recording of data
associated with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
This document specifies the exact manner in which,
under CGNS conventions, CFD data structures (the SIDS) are to be
stored in, i.e., mapped onto, the file structure provided by a
database manager. Adherence to the mapping conventions guarantees
uniform meaning and location of CFD data within CGNS files,
and thereby allows the construction of universal software to
read and write the data.
Physical data storage is accomplished via a general database manager,
either ADF (Advanced Data Format) or HDF (Hierarchical Data Format).
