\subsection{Software}

The CGNS software is available free of charge, under the terms of the
CGNS License, from SourceForge, at
\textit{http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgns}.
Also available there are the \textit{cgnstools} utilities, the source
code examples from \textit{A User's Guide to CGNS}, and additional
Fortran source code examples.

The CGNS Library contains source code for both the Mid-Level Library and
the ADF Core, plus makefiles and a configure script for building the
library for a variety of platforms.

\subsection{Documentation}

The CGNS documentation may be accessed via the CGNS Documentation home
page at {\itshape\url{http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/cgns/}}.
Documentation may also be available for the current beta version of CGNS.
All the CGNS documentation is available in both PDF and HTML forms.

In addition to the CGNS documentation itself, several conference papers
and slide presentations are available, as well as minutes from the CGNS
meetings and telecons.
