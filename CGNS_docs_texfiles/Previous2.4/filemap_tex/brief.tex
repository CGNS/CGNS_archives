\section{Brief Description of CGNS}
\label{s:brief}
\thispagestyle{plain}

The CFD General Notation System (CGNS) is a set of standards, together
with software implementing those standards, for the recording of data
associated with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
Physical data storage is accomplished via a general database manager,
either ADF (Advanced Data Format) or HDF (Hierarchical Data Format).
The present document describes the mapping from the Standard Interface
Data Structures (SIDS) to the file structure provided by the ADF
database manager.
A similar document, the \textit{SIDS-to-HDF File Mapping Manual},
describes the mapping for the HDF database manager.
