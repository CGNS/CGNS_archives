- To create filename.pic from filename.flo, do

     f filename

- "Example Hierarchy" (Figure 1 in LaTeX/PDF document) created by
  first creating the .pic file from the .flo file:

     f example_hierarchy
 
  then editing the file example_hierarchy.pic to change the total width
  of the picture from 71 to the correct value of 64, naming the result
  example_hierarchy_cet.pic.  (Is there a bug in flow?)

- The version of the "Example Hierarchy" figure used in the HTML
  document was created as follows:

     - Create a PostScript file

          latex example_hierarchy.tex
          dvips -T 20.0in,11.0in example_hierarchy.dvi -o

     - Edit resulting PostScript file, changing "/hsize 8.5" to
       "/hsize 20.0", to keep figure from being cropped at 8.5 inches.

     - Create the .gif file (lifted from ps2gif, with addition of
       -sPAPERSIZE=ledger, since gs defaults to 8.5x11.

          cat example_hierarchy.ps | gs -q -dNOPAUSE -r95 \
              -sPAPERSIZE=ledger -sDEVICE=ppm -sOutputFile=- - \
              | pnmcrop | cat | ppmtogif -interlace -transparent #ffffff \
              > example_hierarchy.gif

- "Example Node Structure" (Figure 2 in LaTeX/PDF document) created
  by first creating the .pic file from the .flo file:

     f example_node
 
  then editing the file example_node.pic to add the dashed lines,
  naming the result example_node_cet.pic.

- The version of the "Example Node Structure" figure used in the HTML
  document was created as follows:

     - Create a .pic file

          f example_node_html

       (example_node_html.flo is the same as example_node.flo, except
       without the lines joining the nodes, and with different wording
       in the "Parent node" box.)

     - Edit the file example_node_html.pic to add the dashed lines,
       naming the result example_node_html_cet.pic.

     - Create a PostScript file

          latex example_node.tex
          dvips example_node.dvi -o

     - Edit the PostScript file, adding code to color the background of
       the various boxes.

     - Create the .gif file

          ps2gif example_node.ps

- The "flow" package apparently has an input line length limitation.
  For the UserDefinedData figure, after creating the .pic file, you'll
  need to manually edit it to collapse the referenced figures, in the
  box at the top of the figure, to one line.
