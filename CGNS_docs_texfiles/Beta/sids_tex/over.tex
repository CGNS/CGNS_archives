\section*{Overview}
\thispagestyle{plain}

This document contains the Standard Interface Data Structures (SIDS)
definitions for the CFD General Notation System (CGNS) project; this
project was originally a NASA-funded contract under the AST program, but
control has now been completely transferred to a public forum known as
the CGNS Steering Committee.

The purpose of this document is to scope the information that should be
communicated between various CFD application codes; the target is 3--D
multizone, compressible Navier-Stokes analysis.
Attention in this document is not focussed on I/O routines or formats,
but on the precise description of data that should be present in the I/O
of a CFD code or in a CFD database.

This document therefore contains a precise definition of information
pertinent to a CGNS database.
Specifically, the following information is addressed:
\begin{itemize}
\item grid coordinates and elements
\item flow solution data, including nondimensional parameters
\item multizone interface connectivity, including abutting and overset
\item boundary conditions
\item flow equation descriptions
\item time-dependent flow
\item reference states
\item dimensional units and nondimensionalization information associated
      with data
\item convergence history
\item association to geometry definition
\item topologically based hierarchical structures
\end{itemize}
This information is encoded into C-like data structures.
