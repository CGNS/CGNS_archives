This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the storage
of governing equation information in a CGNS file.
It shows the same node tree as described earlier for the
<a href="fig6.html">figure illustrating the storage of boundary
condition information in a CGNS file</a> but with the FlowEquationSet
node expanded instead of the ZoneBC node.

<p>
Below the FlowEquationSet node are the following nodes.
<ul>
<li> "EquationDimension", marked with a file icon
<li> "GoverningEquations", marked with a folder icon, and expanded
<li> "GasModel", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "ViscosityModel", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "ThermalConductivityModel", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "TurbulenceClosure", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "TurbulenceModel", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
</ul>

<p>
Below the GoverningEquations node is the node DiffusionModel, marked
with a file icon.

<p>
In the node tree the GoverningEquations node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Base/Zone 1/FlowEquationSet", the node name is GoverningEquations, and
the node label is GoverningEquations_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is C1, the dimensions
value is 11, and the bytes value is 11.
The string NSTurbulent is shown in the node data panel.
