This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the storage
of convergence history information in a CGNS file.
It shows the same node tree as described earlier for a
<a href="fig2.html">typical view of a CGNS file</a>, but with the
GlobalConvergenceHistory node expanded.

<p>
Below the GlobalConvergenceHistory node are the following nodes, all
marked with a file icon.
<ul>
<li> "RSDMassRMS"
<li> "CoefLift"
<li> "CoefDrag"
<li> "CoefPressureDrag"
<li> "CoefViscousDrag"
<li> "CoefForceX"
<li> "CoefForceY"
<li> "CoefForceZ"
<li> "CoefMomentX"
<li> "CoefMomentY"
<li> "CoefMomentZ"
<li> "ControlSurfaceMassFlow"
<li> "ControlSurfaceMomentumForce"
<li> "ControlSurfacePressureForce"
<li> "ControlSurfaceViscousForce"
<li> "ControlSurfaceForce"
<li> "RSDTurbEqn1RMS"
<li> "RSDTurbEqn2RMS"
<li> "BadPointsTurbEqn1"
</ul>
There are additional nodes below the GlobalConvergenceHistory node, not
currently visible, as indicated by the scroll bar to the right of the
node tree panel.

<p>
In the node tree the RSDMassRMS node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Base/GlobalConvergenceHistory", the node name is RSDMassRMS, and the
node label is DataArray_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is R8, the dimensions
value is 751, and the bytes value is 6008.
Data values are shown in the node data panel.
