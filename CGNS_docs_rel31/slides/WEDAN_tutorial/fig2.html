<p>
This figure is an image of the
<a href="../../cgnstools/adfviewer/index.html">ADFviewer</a> main
window, and shows the structure of a CGNS file after writing the grid
coordinates.
The window is divided into several areas, or panels.

<p>
Along the top are the menu items, followed by a series of toolbar
buttons.
Below these, on the left is the expandable/collapsible node tree.
On the right, from top to bottom, are the node description, link
description, and data description panels, a row of node-related buttons,
and the node data panel.

<p>
At the top of the node tree is the root node of the ADF file, named
simply "/", and shown with a folder icon.
The next line is the "CGNSLibraryVersion" node, marked with a file icon.

<p>
Next is the base node for the CGNS database, named "Example" in this
case, and marked with a folder icon.
The left is a "-" sign, indicating that the Basename node has been
expanded, and clicking the "-" sign will collapse it.

<p>
Below the Example node is a zone node named "Cube", marked with a
folder icon, and expanded.
Below the Cube node is a node named "ZoneType" marked with a file icon,
and the grid coordinates node named "GridCoordinates", marked with a
folder icon, and expanded.
Below the GridCoordinates node are nodes named "CoordinateX",
"CoordinateY", and "CoordinateZ", each marked with a file icon.

<p>
In the node tree the CoordinateX node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Example/Cube/GridCoordinates", the node name is CoordinateX, and the
node label is DataArray_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is R4, the dimensions
values are 5, 5, 5, and the bytes value is 500.
The x coordinate values are shown in the node data panel.
