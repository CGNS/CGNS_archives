<p>
This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the
specification of generalized abutting grid connectivity.
It shows the same node tree as described for
<a href="fig11.html">one-to-one connectivity</a>, except that below the
ZoneGridConnectivity node is a node named "Cube -> Cylinder", marked
with a folder icon and expanded.
Below the Periodic node are nodes named "GridConnectivityType",
"PointList", "CellListDonor", and "InterpolantsDonor", each marked with
a file icon.

<p>
In the node tree the Cube -> Cylinder node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Example/Cylinder/ZonalGridconnectivity", the node name is Cube ->
Cylinder, and the node label is Gridconnectivity1to1_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is C1, the dimensions
value is 8, and the bytes value is 8.
The string "Cylinder" is shown in the node data panel.
