This figure illustrates the data flow between the various elements of
CGNS.
On the left is a box representing the CFD application.
It's connected by an arrow, pointing in both directions, to a box
labeled "API" representing the CGNS Application Programming Interface.
A box labeled "Internal Data Representation" is connected to the API,
also by a bi-directional arrow.
The API is also connected by bi-directional arrow to a box labeled
"ADF Core" representing the ADF database management routines, and
the ADF Core is similarly connected to a box labeled "Storage Media"
representing the file containing the CGNS database.
