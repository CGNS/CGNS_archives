This is a plot of the total wall clock time in seconds vs the number of
processors.
There are three curves, one for the small-grid case (50&times;50&times;50
in each zone), one for the medium-grid case (150&times;150&times;150 in
each zone), and one for the large-grid case (250&times;250&times;250 in
each zone).
For all three grids, the time increases roughly linearly with the number
of processors, as follows:
<ul>
<li> For the small-grid case, from nearly 0 for one processor to about
     180 for eight processors
<li> For the medium-grid case, from about 5 for one processor to about
     218 for eight processors
<li> For the large-grid case, from about 19 for one processor to about
     130 for four processors
</ul>
