This figure illustrates how geometric entities and mesh regions may be
associated in CGNS.
On the right is a box labeled "Geometry Data" representing a geometric
entity like a wing surface, or nacelle.
It's connected by an arrow, pointing in both directions, to a box
labeled "Intermediate Object / CFD Family", which is similarly connected
to a box labeled "Mesh Entities" representing the regions of the
computational mesh that correspond to the geometric entity.
