This is an image of the ADFviewer main window showing the CGNS file
structure after the fifth part of the example.
It shows the same node tree as described after the
<a href="fig8.html">fourth part of the example</a> but with the
ZoneBC node expanded.

<p>
Below the ZoneBC node are nodes named "Quads_SymmetryPlane",
"Trias_Wing", "Trias_SymmetryPlane", and "Trias_Farfield", each marked
with a folder icon.
The Quads_SymmetryPlane node is expanded, and below it are nodes named
"ElementList" and "FamilyName", each marked with a file icon.

<p>
In the node tree the ElementList node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Base/Main/ZoneBC/Quads_SymmetryPlane", the node name is ElementList,
and the node label is IndexArray_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is I4, the dimensions
values are 1 5064, and the bytes value is 20256.
The elements are shown in the node data panel.
