This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the storage
of the number of grid points and elements in a zone.
It shows the same node tree as described earlier for the
<a href="fig2.html">example unstructured grid</a> but with the Main node
highlighted in the node tree.

<p>
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is "/Base",
the node name is Main, and the node label is Zone_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is I4, the dimensions
values are 1, 3, and the bytes value is 12.
The three values shown in the node data panel are 696894, representing
the number of grid points, and 1901144, representing the number of
volume elements.
