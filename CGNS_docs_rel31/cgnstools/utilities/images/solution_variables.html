The ADFviewer Solution Variables window has three sections, from top to

First is a section titled "Variables".

and "Conserved", and a text input box labeled "gamma".
These are followed by a check box labeled "Use Conversion File", and
a button labeled "Edit Conversion File".
Below these is a text input box labeled "Filename", with a "Browse"
button to the right.

Next is the "CGNS Input" section, with four text input boxes, labeled
"Filename", "Base Index", "Zone Index", and "Solution Index".
At the right of the first box is a "Browse" button.
At the right of the other three text boxes are check boxes labeled
"default", "all zones", and "all solutions", respectively.

<p>
The third section is the "CGNS Output" section, with two text input
boxes, labeled "Filename" and "Solution Name".
To the right of the first box is a "Browse" button, and to the right of
