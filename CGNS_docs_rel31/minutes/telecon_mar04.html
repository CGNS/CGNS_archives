<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Telecon Minutes</h2>

25 March 2004<br>
11:00 AM Eastern Time<br><br>

<ol>
<li> The meeting was called to order at 11:05 AM.  There were
     <a href="#attendees">13 attendees</a>, listed below.
<br><br>
<li> The minutes of the <a href="meeting_jan04.html">7 January 2004
     Reno meeting</a> were reviewed and approved as posted on the web
     site.
<br><br>
<li> Status of previous action items:<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Wedan to post latest and greatest HDF-5 version (including
          link capability) to SourceForge.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> done; SourceForge package is "adfh".
               Users will also need to download HDF5 itself, and build it. 
          </ul>
     <li> Rumsey to check with Towne to see if documentation still
          exists for <tt>ElementList</tt> and <tt>Range</tt> (removed
          prior to V2).
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> done - some was there, and some was written
          </ul>
     <li> Wedan will look into issue of links further (perhaps can
          modify open call so it does not follow links).
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> looked into it - will take some considerable work, so not
               done yet (<u>keep as open item</u>)
          </ul>
     <li> Rumsey will finalize updated CGNS Charter and send to Towne to
          post.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> done
          </ul>
     <li> Wedan will prepare V2.3 for official release - need to
          coordinate with change to SIDS for <tt>ElementList</tt> and
          <tt>Range</tt>.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> done, but documentation still needs to be taken off beta
               status
          </ul>
     <li> Wedan will look into formally archiving all old versions of
          the software.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> old versions have been archived on ICEM's machines
          <li> Wedan will post to SourceForge at some point in the future
               (<u>action item carries</u>)
          </ul>
     <li> Wedan will remove the webpage containing binaries - in the
          future, all software must be obtained through SourceForge.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> done - now directs you to SourceForge or to old archived
               files
          </ul>
     <li> Rumsey to send a summary of priority list of Proposals for
          Extension to Edwards.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> done
          </ul>
     </ol>
<br>
<li> ISO status/discussion (Cosner):<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> No change in status to report.  There is no hard "no"
          regarding future funding, but not encouraging, either.  In the
          ISO process, we are still good for 18 months more.
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Documentation issues and CGNStalk issues (Towne):<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Spam issue on CGNSTalk is still bothersome, but generally
          tends to be only a few per week.  This is felt to be not worth
          taking any action on yet.
     <li> Current documentation is still V2.2 (2.3 is still in beta
          status). <u>Towne will take V2.3 documentation out of beta
          status</u>. The 2.2 documentation will be moved to the "prior
          version" location, and the 2.1 documentation will be removed.
     <li> For latest SIDS (i.e., consistent with CGNS Version 2.3)
          as recommended practice, the formal review period will
          begin near mid-April and will last approximately 1 month
          (Craig Day at AIAA will set this up).  After that, a formal
          CGNS Steering Committee ballot will be done to approve the
          revision.
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Software status/discussion (Wedan):<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Discussion took place regarding <tt>ElementList</tt> and
          <tt>Range</tt> capability, which was recently re-added
          with V2.3.  By default, V2.3 SIDS allows both the use of
          <tt>PointList/Range</tt> with <tt>GridLocation=CellCenter</tt>
          OR the new <tt>ElementList/Range</tt> feature.  This is
          currently how the V2.3 documentation reads.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Wedan has suggested eliminating the
               <tt>Pointlist/Range</tt> + <tt>CellCenter</tt>
               possibility (and thus removing the need for
               <tt>GridLocation</tt> under <tt>BC_t</tt>).  So to
               summarize, the two choices are:
               <ol>
               <li> allow existing usage of <tt>PointList/Range</tt>
                    with <tt>GridLocation=CellCenter</tt> AND add new
                    <tt>ElementList/Range</tt> capability (current
                    default in V2.3), or:
               <li> change SIDS so when <tt>PointList/Range</tt>
                    are used, they mean vertices only; drop
                    <tt>GridLocation</tt> from <tt>BC_t</tt>
               </ol>
          <li> An informal e-mail vote was split on the decision.
               During the discussion here, most people felt it would
               be better in the long run to go with Wedan's suggestion
               (number 2).  Wedan could make the API automatically fix
               files doing it the old way (transparent to the user), so
               backward compatability will not be a problem.
          <li> It was finally decided to go with Wedan's suggestion, but
               only when the next major release occurs.  This way, there
               is plenty of time to make changes in the beta releases
               of the API (Wedan) and documentation (Towne) (<u>open
               items</u>).
          </ul>
     <li> Discussion took place regarding recent discussion topic on
          CGNSTalk about CGNS slowness on Linux.  It appears to be a
          Linux Red Hat 8.0 problem, writing to a remotely-mounted
          disk.  The suggestion was made that Red Hat 9.0 might fix the
          problem.
     </ol>
<br>
<li> HDF-5 status/discussion (Wedan):<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Wedan has been in communication with someone from NCSA
          (HDF-5); fixing bugs in HDF-5, looking at things that might
          need changing in CGNS to improve its usability with HDF-5
          (e.g.: character strings would be better for HDF-5 than
          character arrays)
     <li> Earlier HDF-5 problem writing over 150 children has been fixed
          with a recent HDF-5 version
     <li> Tracking creation order ("creation tracking") is still a
          problem with HDF-5 - they will probably fix this
     <li> Using HDF-5 rather than ADF is still slower and bigger (up to
          4 times) for smaller files (less than 1-2 meg or so).  For
          bigger files, the differences are smaller.  Performance should
          also improve with new future versions of HDF-5.
     <li> Wedan has not yet looked into compression capability of HDF-5
          (<u>open item</u>)
     <li> HDF-5 is still the direction we want to eventually go, because
          (1) we don't need to maintain it, (2) it has parallel I/O
          capability, and (3) lots of other people use it
     <li> There is no current date planned for switching over.  We
          need to be very sensitive to any possible impact on vendors
          using CGNS. <u>Rumsey will form an informal task force to
          begin looking at timing for this, and to develop a list of
          things that need to be done prior to switching over (initial
          volunteers are Hauser, Edwards, Hann, van der Weide, Wall,
          Wedan - Poinot will also likely join).</u>
     <li> Parallel I/O has not yet been implemented completely. Hauser
          is currently still working on parallel capability of HDF-5
          version.  He has a paper at an upcoming conference in May.
          <u>Hauser will send his paper (and his earlier Reno paper) to
          Towne to post.</u>
     <li> There is currently a converter available that translates ADF
          &lt;-&gt; HDF-5.
     <li> Mid-level library currently cannot distinguish between ADF
          and HDF-5.  If you try to read the wrong one, you will get an
          error message.  Eventually, we will develop a converter to
          make the conversion automatically.
     <li> The HDF-5 version of CGNS will definitely remain as beta for
          now.  The informal task force will help decide when it is most
          to our advantage (and when we are ready) to switch officially.
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Extensions status/discussion (Edwards):<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Intelligent Light (Ken Wall) is starting on the agreed-upon
          extensions (six of them), as part of their SBIR.  They are
          starting with the <tt>UserDefined</tt> extension. They
          still need to get CVS version of the software.  Testing
          of <tt>UserDefined</tt> &amp; <tt>BCDataSet</tt> will
          be done (at least) by Rumsey &amp; Poinot.  Testing of
          Partial read/write, <tt>Family</tt> extension, and added
          <tt>GridConnectivityProperty</tt> extension will be done
          (at least) by van der Weide and Alonso.  Testing of
          Electromagnetics will probably be done by Bush and Fisher.
          Other people interested in testing the new extensions should
          contact Rumsey, Edwards, or Wall.
     <li> Testing of the new extensions will be done using both the
          existing F77 example test codes, and also Wall will write
          new tests for the new extensions, and will add them to the
          repository of tests codes.
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Other issues:<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Poinot will be presenting a CGNS paper in Portland AIAA
          meeting.
     <li> <u>Rumsey will set up a CGNS meeting for Portland (probably
          Wed PM).</u> Depending on the number of attendees, this may be
          either informal (like last summer's meeting) or else will be a
          regular steering committee meeting.
     <li> Question came up regarding how to test if a file is
          SIDS-compatible or not. Wedan has an incomplete method
          available (needs more work).  Poinot has an XML CGNS
          "compiler" he has been developing that performs check.
     <li> Suggestion was made to add to the example files as well as
          programs that generate example files to the CGNS website.
          <u>Alonso and Hann will send Wedan some of their examples, and
          Wedan will post them.</u>
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Meeting was adjourned at 12:20 PM.<br><br>
<li> Summary of <b><u>action items</u></b>:<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Wedan will formally archive old versions of software on
          SourceForge.
     <li> Towne will take V2.3 documentation out of beta status.
     <li> Rumsey will form an informal task force to begin looking
          at timing for switch to HDF-5, and to develop a list of
          things that need to be done prior to switching over (initial
          volunteers are Hauser, Edwards, Hann, van der Weide, Wall,
          Wedan - Poinot will also likely join).
     <li> Hauser will send his May paper (and his earlier Reno paper) to
          Towne to post.
     <li> Rumsey will set up a CGNS meeting for Portland (probably Wed
          PM).
     <li> Alonso and Hann will send Wedan some of their examples of CGNS
          files and programs that write/read them, and Wedan will post
          them.
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Summary of <b><u>open items</u></b> (these are different from
     action items, in that they are open or unresolved issues that we
     want to keep track of, but there are no specific actions required
     of anyone at this point in time):<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Issue of links causing slowdown (perhaps can modify open call
          so it does not follow links).
     <li> With next major release, eliminate the
          <tt>Pointlist/Range</tt> + <tt>CellCenter</tt> possibility
          (and thus remove the need for <tt>GridLocation</tt> under
          <tt>BC_t</tt>).  Next major release of API will need to
          automatically make the alteration (transparent to the
          user). Documentation (SIDS, User's Guide, other?) will need to
          be changed.
     <li> Need to look into compression capability of HDF-5.
     </ol>
