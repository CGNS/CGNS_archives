<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Telecon Minutes</h2>

17 May 2001<br>
2:00pm Eastern Time<br><br>

Telecon Number: (601) 354-1086, participant code: 374105

<p>
The meeting was called to order at 2:00 Eastern time.
There were 14 attendees, <a href="#attendees">listed below</a>.

<ul>
<li> <b>Charter/Membership</b> - Michael Marchant from CFX/AEA Technology
     attended the telecon for the first time.  Mike introduced himself as
     the Meshing Team Leader and indicated that CFX now supports import and
     export of CGNS files.  They would like to become more active in the
     Steering Committee.  Diane Poirier indicated that she would add them to
     the list of applications on the web.  Welcome Mike.

     <p>
     Not mentioned at the telecon, the charter has been updated on the web to
     include the current list of steering committee members.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Issues</b> - There will be an informal meeting at the AIAA summer
     conferences in Anehiem Calif.  We have requested a room for Tuesday
     evening at 7:00.  The room number should be posted at the conference.
     We welcome all who can attend.  (7 of the attendees indicated that they
     would attend the Anaheim conference, so we anticipate a reasonable
     turn-out for the meeting.)  An agenda will be sent to the entire
     committee before the meeting.

     <p>
     Discussions on if CGNS should be published as an AIAA Standard are still
     underway.  There will be a telecon on this subject between Ray Cosner
     (AIAA CFD Committee on Standards), Jim French (AIAA Staff) and Bob Bush
     (CGNS Steering Committee) on 29 May.  Bob will report the results of the
     discussion at the meeting in Anaheim.

     <p>
     Dave Edwards reported on progress in preparing for the Reno conference
     in January.  He thinks it would be timely to have another technical
     paper on the status of CGNS, and can arrange for an invitation for
     the ICG session.  Dave will be sending out a questionnaire to collect
     data for the paper.  We also discussed the idea of having a Steering
     Committee and/or User's meeting.  We tentatively decided to hold a
     one-hour Steering Committee meeting before a publicly announced User's
     meeting.
<br><br>
<li> <b>ISO Status</b> - Ray Cosner could not attend, but sent the
     following report:

     <blockquote>
     <tt>The next meeting of ISO Standing Committee 4 will be June 11-15, in San
     Francisco.  This is the group whose responsibility includes the Fluid
     Dynamics standard.  I expect this will be a fairly low-key meeting from
     the Fluid Dynamics perspective - no major decisions are to be made
     at this one. The primary activity will be to continue the process of
     reviewing and updating the drafts of the standard.  Since the previous
     meeting of this group in February, we have been receiving comments
     and updating the documentation.  All the comments received have been
     minor.  People in several countries have agreed to put in some time at
     their own expense to help us develop the standard.  Those countries
     are: US, UK, Switzerland, Sweden, Japan, and Germany.  The next meeting
     of Standing Committee 4 will be in October, in Fukuoka Japan.  This will
     be a major meeting for the Fluid Dynamics standard - we hope to pass
     Gate 3 (Committee Draft) for all the parts of the AP 237 standard.  To
     do this, we will have to have a draft we consider to be complete in all
     respects.  Once we reach that stage, we will have to institute a formal
     process of recording and responding to all comments we receive.  Our
     response can be 'we received your comment and we choose to ignore it'
     (not a bright idea) but we have to respond.</tt>
     </blockquote>

     <p>
     Ray also sent the updated documentation to Bob Bush for comment and
     review.  This information will be forwarded to Diane Poirier for
     inclusion on the Web site.  All members of the committee are urged to
     review this documentation to ensure consistency with the intent of
     making a smooth transition of CGNS to an ISO standard.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Logo Status</b> - John Chawner could not attend, but indicated
     via e-mail that the logo has been revised and is ready for approval and
     posting.  An initial version has been posted on the web, and some minor
     comments of John's addressed.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Documentation</b> - Charlie Towne indicated that an HTML version
     of all the documentation is now available on the web.  He is also
     working on a revision to the Mid-Level Library documentation that will
     hopefully make it easier to use.

     <p>
     Chris Rumsey indicated that he has gotten little feedback on the draft
     User's Guide.  However, it has been used by some groups, and has been
     helpful in providing answers and a reference for several listbot
     questions that have come up.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Software Support</b> - There has been little progress in
     identifying a Software Focal Point.  Doug McCarthy could not attend the
     telecon, and there is no progress on drafting a contribution strategy
     as a potential source of funding for Software Support.  On the positive
     side however, the listbot has been a great help in getting questions
     answered.  Our biggest need now is to implement extensions that are
     ready, and to provide a mechanism for bug fixes.

     <p>
     In the mean time, all parties are encouraged to continue to work on
     gaining consensus for the various extensions.  We would like to get the
     extensions to the point where they are well enough defined to begin
     implementation and the documentation is ready for inclusion in the SIDS.
     (However, we do not anticipate updating the SIDS until the extension has
     been implemented.)
<br><br>
<li> <b>Extension Status</b> - There was brief discussion of the various
     extension proposals.  Many are somewhat stagnant and need to be
     re-invigorated.  Currently we rely on the originator to keep them
     moving.
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> Chemistry - Bush - Ready for implementation
     <li> Rotating Coordinates - Bush - Ready for implementation
     <li> API Link support - in SIDS - Ready for implementation
     <li> User defined arrays - Rumsey - need to choose a strategy
     <li> Hierarchical structures - Patel
     <li> Hanging Nodes - Edwards
     <li> Spray/2phase flow - Darian
     <li> Wall Functions
     <li> Turbomachinery BC's
     </ul>
<br>
<li> <b>Utilities</b> - Ed Hall indicated that he is still interested
     in pursuing generating various utilities to operate on CGNS files.
     He indicated that CGNS support has been added to the OpenGL version
     of PLOT3D that is now being supported by NASA Ames (Stuart Rogers -
     <i>rogers@nas.nasa.gov</i>).  He would also like to develop a Viewer/Editor
     based on JAVA, and has internal funding but no manpower at this point.

     <p>
     David Edwards indicated that Intelligent Light has developed a CGNS
     inspector for their internal development that might serve as a good
     starting point for Ed Hall's activity.  He was encouraged to send it
     to Diane Poirier to make it available as a download from the Utilities
     page.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Additional</b> - Release Status - Diane Poirier indicated that we
     are ready to release V2 beta2 as the production V2, and will take the
     beta designation off the web.  For the present we will retain the older
     versions of the software on the web as well.
