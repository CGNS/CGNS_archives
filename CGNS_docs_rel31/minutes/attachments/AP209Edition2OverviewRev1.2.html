AP209 Edition 2 Overview<br>

<h2>AP209 Edition 1 Background and Overview</h2>

<p>
The Design/Analysis integration problem is typified by the requirement
to share geometric shape and analysis information in an iterative
environment. The integration is made more difficult when composite
structures become a part of the problem. Figure 1 illustrates the
interconnectivity that this overview addresses. Most production systems
currently employ specific point-to-point translators to enable this
process, and very few analysis systems are able to seamlessly return
geometric shape information to the design shape modeler. With composite
structures there are the additional problems of calculating true fiber
directions and ply flat patterns that are shared with the manufacturing
process. All of this information needs to be shared with commercial or
inhouse detailed analysis codes such as those for fastened joints and
panel buckling.

<p>
Given this problem AP 209 Edition 1 was created to enable:
<ul>
<li> <b>Collaborative analysis and design</b>: Companies using different
     CAD and FEA systems will be able to exchange engineering design and
     analysis data using standard file formats. The same data schema
     used to share information via standard file formats is also usable
     to dynamically share information tool to tool.  Configuration
     management data within the standard can ensure that design and
     analysis activities carried out by the different teams relate to
     the correct product versions.
     <p>
     It is possible to provide separate, but associated, versioning for
     the product, the analysis idealisation of the product, and for the
     finite element model.<br>
<li> <b>Archiving of analysis and design data</b>: A company will
     be able to archive associated, configuration managed CAD and
     FEA data in standard format, confident that that data can be
     reused in the future, whatever system changes have occurred. This
     is of special importance where FEA has been used for product
     certification, because additional analyses may be required to
     investigate in-service problems.<br><br>
<li> <b>Development of integrated systems</b>: A company will be able
     to develop an integrated system combining design and analysis
     based upon standard interfaces.  Such an integrated system may
     address different analysis disciplines such as structural, thermal
     and fluids, and may be used for design optimisation. The use of
     standard interfaces will ensure that the system is not locked-in to
     a particular system supplier.
</ul>

<p>
AP 209 Edition 1 covers:
<ul>
<li> <b>Finite element data</b>: This includes models, analysis
     definitions and load cases, and results. A model can be specified
     in as much detail as required - if necessary down to the level of
     element shape functions, discretisation points and integration
     rules. Static and natural frequency analyses are within the initial
     scope.<br><br>
<li> <b>Configuration management data</b>: A version of the finite
     element model is linked to a version of the product. This ensures
     that the correct finite element data may be associated with the
     correct version of a product within a PDM (Product Data Management)
     system.<br><br>
<li> <b>Product geometry</b>: Both the design geometry and the idealised
     geometry created for analysis can be recorded. Nodes, finite
     elements, their edges, faces and volumes can be explicitly
     associated with aspects of the product geometry.  It is possible to
     specify element properties, loadings or boundary conditions on a
     curve, edge, surface, or volume of the geometric model.<br><br>
<li> <b>Composite lay-up</b>: The lay-up of a composite part can be
     specified in detail.  Shape, stacking sequence, and property
     information can be supplied about individual plies and their fibre
     orientations.
</ul>

<h2>AP209 Edition 2</h2>

<p>
The second Edition of ISO 10303-209 (AP209) has integrated a generic
Engineering Analysis capability complimented by specific CFD and
generalized mesh based numerical analysis capabilities to the AP209
Edition 1 classical Finite Element Analysis capabilities. The CFD
capability is based upon the NASA/AIAA CGNS standard and the Volvo Aero
EAR-model work. The generalized structured and unstructured analysis and
mesh capabilities are based upon work done in the Generic Engineering
Analysis Model (GEM) project from the European Union. In addition there
is a complete discrete/continuous mathematical field representation
capability that has been added based upon the Daved Talyor Labs/Boeing
DT-NURBS package. All of these added capabilities have been integrated
into the STEP common resources Parts 50, 51, 52, 53, 107, and 110 as
a basis for use in Application Protocols. The intent is that AP209E2
will now address a much wider set of multi-disciplinary analysis and
optimization problems

<p>
A high-level planning diagram that provides an overview of the contents
of AP209E2 is shown in Figure 2. The SC4 community has gone to a
modular approach to developing Application Protocols (APs) to promote
integration and ease of re-use. Due the modularization of existing
AP209 capabilities it is now possible to take advantage of this new SC4
Modular Architecture by embedding the second edition of AP203 and get
all the new shape, presentation, and GD&amp;T capabilities.

Figures 3 and 4 provide a more detailed overview of the capabilities
of AP209E2. Figure 3 illustrates the AP203E2 capabilities portion of
AP209E2. Here there is more detail on the new Presentation, shape, and
product characteristic capabilities. Note that the composite structure
shape, structure, and material properties capabilities from the first
edition of AP209 have now been incorporated into AP203E2. Figure 4
shows more detail of the modular components of the classical Finite
Element capability, and the added capabilities for generic structured
and unstructured mesh based numerical analysis, CFD, and field based
property definition.
