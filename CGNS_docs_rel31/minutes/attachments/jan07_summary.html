</ul>

<h2>Current emphasis</h2>

<ul>
<li> Technical:
     <ul>
     <li> Seamless inter-usability between ADF and HDF5 (with HDF5
          "officially" recommended by the committee)
     <li> Parallel HDF5 capability
     <li> Ensure bugs get fixed &amp; docs remain up-to-date
     <li> Keep up with extensions (submission / approval / implementation)
     </ul>
<li> Other:
     <ul>
     <li> Promote acceptance through:
          <ul>
          <li> Papers/presentations (e.g., Poinot, Hauser 2005 &amp; 2006)
          <li> Tutorial Session at AIAA San Francisco meeting 2006
          <li> Panel Discussion at San Francisco meeting 2006
          <li> Develop possible short course for AIAA (in process)
          </ul>
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>New/additional emphasis needed?</h2>

<ul>
<li> Strive to secure funding for software development and support
     (through AIAA short course? other?)
<li> Improve extension proposal, approval, and implementation process
     <ul>
     <li> Proposal template? Guaranteed process timeline?
     <li> Extending MLL is difficult
     </ul>
<li> Develop official certification process
     <ul>
     <li> Define levels of compliance?
     </ul>
<li> More extensive updates to website - include Wiki page?
<li> Ideas to overcome vendor &amp; user inertia?
<li> If we want to pursue any of these items, they need a leader and
     probably a small sub-committee
</ul>
