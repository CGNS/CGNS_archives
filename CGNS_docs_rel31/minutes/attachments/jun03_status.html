<h2>Outline</h2>

<ul>
<li> Introduction
<li> Recent accomplishments
<li> Where we are
<li> Current issues/needss
<li> Where we are going
</ul>

<h2>What is CGNS?</h2>

<ul>
<li> Standard for defining &amp; storing CFD data
     <ul>
     <li> Self-descriptive
     <li> Machine-independent
     <li> Very general and extendable
     <li> Administered by international steering committee
     </ul>
<li> AIAA recommended practice (AIAA R-101-2002)
<li> In process of becoming international ISO standard
<li> Free and open software
<li> www.cgns.org
</ul>

<h2>Typical CGNS file</h2>

<h2>Makeup of CGNS</h2>

<ul>
<li> Standard Interface Data Structures (SIDS) is the core of CGNS -
     defines the intellectual content
<li> Low level implementation is currently Advanced Data Format (ADF)
     <ul>
     <li> Basic direct I/O operations
     <li> Software has no knowledge of data structure or contents
     <li> Tree-based (nodal parent/child) structure
     </ul>
<li> Mid-level library (MLL) is currently available for C and Fortran
     <ul>
     <li> This is what most users employ
     <li> Software has some knowledge of SIDS
     <li> C++ and Python extensions also available
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Recent accomplishments</h2>

<ul>
<li> CGNS now maintained on and available from SourceForge
     (sourceforge.net)
<li> Latest version is 2.2
<li> Utility "adfviewer" available for viewing &amp; translating CGNS
     files
<li> Extensive web-based and pdf documentation available
<li> CGNStalk@grc.nasa.gov discussion group
</ul>

<h2>Where we are</h2>

<ul>
<li> SIDS &amp; software reliable and well-tested
<li> Most current proposals for extension (to SIDS) are relatively
     minor/specific
<li> Acceptance as ISO standard is progressing (but stalled in 2003 due
     to budgeting problem)
<li> Many people beginning to use CGNS, but mostly as an "option" - it
     has yet to gain full acceptance as a standard
</ul>

<h2>Current issues/needs</h2>

<ul>
<li> Replacement of underlying ADF with HDF5
     <ul>
     <li> Prototype (written by Poinot) is available
     <li> Needs evaluation and further work
     <li> Adds parallel capability and would help propel CGNS to wider
          use/acceptance
     </ul>
<li> Need to reconcile ISO specs (STEP documents) with latest SIDS
<li> New proposals for extension need review, then implementation
</ul>

<h2>Where we are going</h2>

<ul>
<li> Resolve current issues/needs (last slide)
<li> Replace ADF with HDF5 for commonality and growth
<li> Continue "advertising": Poinot et al. abstract submitted for Reno
     2004, "Impact of CGNS on CFD Workflow"
<li> Push to get more of the widely-used CFD codes to implement CGNS
<li> Maintain an active &amp; diverse steering committee
</ul>

<h1>Discussion of recent issues raised on CGNSTalk</h1>

<h2>UserDefined extension</h2>

<ul>
<li> Allow the following additional children:
     <ul>
     <li> PointRange, PointList, GridLocation, FamilyName, Ordinal
     </ul>
<li> Would need new MLL functions, e.g.:
     <ul>
     <li> cg_ptset_write, cg_ptset_read, cg_ptset_info
     </ul>
<li> Purpose: extends usefulness of UserDefined node
</ul>

<h2>BCDataSet extension</h2>

<ul>
<li> Allow the following additional children:
     <ul>
     <li> PointRange, PointList, GridLocation
     </ul>
<li> Would need new MLL functions, e.g.:
     <ul>
     <li> cg_ptset_write, cg_ptset_read, cg_ptset_info
     </ul>
<li> Purpose: allows auxiliary BC data info to reside at different grid
     location from the indices that define the BC patch
</ul>

<h2>CGNSVersion issue</h2>

<ul>
<li> Problem: if write CGNS file without CGNSLibraryVersion node, then
     reading the file using MLL can cause problems
<li> Current fix: make CGNSLibraryVersion node mandatory part of CGNS
     file (this is a fix to the documentation only)
<li> Question: is a proposal for a separate CGNSVersion node needed?
     <ul>
     <li> Maybe not, because MLL and SIDS maintain the same numbering
          (e.g., "2.2")
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>GridLocation issue</h2>

<ul>
<li> Currently, connectivity information is always with respect to the
     vertices for abutting-type interfaces, and can be either Vertex or
     CellCenter for overset-type
<li> Should GridLocation=FaceCenter also be allowed?
     <ul>
     <li> Particularly desirable for unstructured grids
     </ul>
</ul>
