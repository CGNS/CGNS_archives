<p>
This chart illustrates the file structure for two CGNS files, one (File
1) containing a flow solution and the other (File 2) containing a grid,
with a link between them.

<p>
On the left is File 1, and on the right is File 2.
For both files, below the root node is the CGNSBase_t node, named
FlowSolutionBase in File 1 and GridBase in File 2.
In both files the CGNSBase_t node has the following data:
<pre>
   CellDimension = 3
   PhysicalDimension = 3
</pre>

<p>
Below the CGNSBase_t node in both files is a Zone_t node, named Zone 1,
containing the following data:
<pre>
   VertexSize = (21,17,9)
   CellSize = (20,16,8)
   VertexSizeBoundary = (0,0,0)
</pre>

<p>
In File 2, below the Zone_t node are two nodes - a ZoneType_t node
named ZoneType, with Data = Structured, and a GridCoordinates_t
node named GridCoordinates, with Data = MT.
Below GridCoordinates_t are child nodes containing the actual grid
coordinates.

<p>
In File 1, below the Zone_t node are two nodes - the same ZoneType_t
node as in File 2, and a FlowSolution_t
node named FlowSolution, with Data = MT.
Below FlowSolution_t are child nodes containing the actual flow
solution.
Also below the Zone_t node in File 1 is a link node, represented
by a line labeled "link" drawn from the Zone_t in File 1 to the
GridCoordinates_t node in File 2.
