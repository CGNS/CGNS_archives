First Order Estimate of AP209E2 Modularization and Extension Tasks<br>
<small>Rev. 2</small>

Keith Hunten, P.E.

<p>
These estimates assume that Keith is working on this with support from
Darla Nettles. The times would be significantly higher if either would
not be able to be the primary producers as significant knowledge of the
AP and the modularization creation and publication process is assumed.

<p>
The following are the Units of Functionality of AP209E1. Many of these
are covered by module work to date, these are marked by an '*', and
those that will have to be extended with '**'.
<ul>
<li> **activity_control;
<li> *advanced_boundary_representation;
<li> analysis_report;
<li> *assembly;
<li> **authorization;
<li> composite_constituent_representation;
<li> *effectivity;
<li> *end_item_identification;
<li> *faceted_boundary_representation;
<li> fea_model;

<li> **part_shape;
<li> *wireframe_with_topology;
<li> zone_composite_constituents_and_their_representation.
</ul>

<p>
Of the 21 UoFs, 12 have modular work to date, with 4 of the 12 requiring
some extension, mostly to deal with the duality of Design Discipline
Product Definition (DDPD) and the Analysis Discipline Product Definition
(ADPD), and the delineation of Nominal, Idealized, and Analysis Shapes.

<p>
The remaining 9 UoFs are unique to AP209 and will have to be
modularized. Of these 9, 5 are concerned with composite structural
definition and representation. The remaining 4 are concerned with Finite
Element Analysis, with a fifth, material, shared with composites.

<h2>Extensions to Existing Modules</h2>

<p>
The extensions tasks will include:
<ul>
<li> adding text definitions;
<li> modifying existing EXPRESS-G diagrams;
<li> generating new ARM EXPRESS;
<li> generating new MIM EXPRESS.
</ul>

<h3>activity_control</h3>
Extensions to apply to APDPD and other AP209 ARM objects, 8 hours.

<h3>authorization</h3>
Extensions to apply to APDPD and other AP209 ARM objects, 8 hours.

<h3>part_identification</h3>
Extensions to apply to APDPD and other AP209 ARM objects, add analysis specific ARM
objects, 24 hours.
<ul>
<li> analysis;
<li> analysis_design_version_relationship;
<li> analysis_discipline_product_definition;
<li> analysis_version;
<li> design_discipline_product_definition;
<li> design_material;
<li> file;
<li> mass_measure.
</ul>

<h3>part_shape</h3>
Extension to apply to the delineation of Nominal, Idealized, and Analysis Shapes, 24 hours.

<li> analysis_shape;
<li> idealized_analysis_shape;
<li> node_shape;

</ul>

<h2>Composite Structural Definition and Representation Modularization</h2>

<p>
The Modularization tasks will include:
<ul>
<li> creating text definitions for ARM and MIM - virtually all will be
     copied from E1 document (1 hour);
<li> transcribing mapping table (1 hour);
<li> creating EXPRESS-G diagrams (2 hours);
<li> generating new ARM EXPRESS (0.1 hour);
<li> generating new MIM EXPRESS (0.1 hour).
</ul>
This results in a rough ROM of 4.2 hours per Application Object (AO). As
there are approximately 80 unique AOs this results in an estimate of 336
hours.

<h2>Implementation and AP Module Creation</h2>

<p>
Roughly half of the Implementation Modules will be taken from
AP203E2. However, some will require some additional modules that will
be created in the tasks above covering modifying existing modules. The
remaining implementation modules will be for composites, materials, and
Finite Element Analysis.

<p>
The plan at the present time is for all of the new AP209 Implementation
Modules to roughly follow the UoFs of AP209. This will result in
significantly larger modules than many produced to date, however there
is no pressing business/sharing requirement for finer granularity
particularly as the components of these UoFs need to be used as
monolithic blocks due to the structure of the Integrated Resources and
the application domain. Given this, the new Implementation modules for
AP209 will be:
<ul>
<li> analysis_report;
<li> composite_constituent_representation;
<li> fea_model;
<li> fe_analysis_control;
<li> fe_analysis_results;
<li> material;
<li> part_composite_constituents;
<li> part_shape;
<li> zone_composite_constituents_and_their_representation.
</ul>

<p>
The Implementation Modularization tasks will include:
<ul>
<li> creating text definitions for ARM and MIM (2 hours);
<li> creating EXPRESS-G diagrams and context diagrams (4 hours);
<li> generating new ARM EXPRESS (1 hour);
<li> generating new MIM EXPRESS (1 hour).
</ul>
This results in a rough ROM of 8 hours per Implementation Module As
there are approximately 9 Implementation Modules this results in an
estimate of 72 hours. In addition the AP level module should take about
10 hours.


<h2>Additional AP209E2 Capabilities</h2>

<p>
There are two major areas where the STEP Integrated Resources have
been extended as part of the ongoing Engineering Analysis Core Model
(EACM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics efforts. The first provides
capabilities to represent continuous and discrete fields to be used
as properties and/or state information. The second provided a generic
structured and unstructured grid representation capability that will
support a large number of non-FEA computational disciplines such as
Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer.

<p>
Finally, a major area of complaint against AP209 is the non-coverage
of Nonlinear Analyses. Though the AP and the underlying Integrated
Resources of STEP were designed to easily be extended to nonlinear, this
was not done due to a time and cost constraint. This would be a fairly
straight-forward and valuable addition to AP209.

<h3>EACM Fields and Properties</h3>

<p>
The EACM field and property extensions are quite small in scope and
would add Application Objects to all of the FEA UoFs. These capabilities
are supported by the 50 series Parts of STEP, and integrated with
Part 104 by Part 107. All of these documents are at DIS or above thus
providing minimal added risk to this task. As there are roughly 30 or so
ARM/MIM objects to be documented an estimate would be:
<ul>
<li> creating text definitions for ARM and MIM (2 hours);
<li> creating mapping table (2 hours)
<li> creating EXPRESS-G diagrams (2 hours);
<li> generating new ARM EXPRESS (0.1 hour);
<li> generating new MIM EXPRESS (0.1 hour).
</ul>
This results in a rough ROM of 6.2 hours per Application Object (AO). As
there are approximately 30 AOs this results in an estimate of 186 hours.

<h3>General Structured and Unstructured Grids and Analyses</h3>

<p>
The second capability addition would require substantially more time
investment - probably on the order of the modularization of the FEM
portion of AP209, about 200 hours.  However there is a possibility that
some help from David Leal and other personnel from the UK BSI/NAFEMS
CAD/FE working group can apply resources to create these modules.

<h3>Nonlinear Analyses</h3>

<p>
The primary task is extending and/or generalizing the field
representations in Part 104 and AP209 to represent nonlinear
components. The other areas are element types and nonlinear boundary
conditions and loads. A small update to Part 104 may also be
required. The general structured and unstructured grids and analysis
capabilities of STEP would need no further update as they now adequately
cover nonlinear analyses. A very rough guess for this addition would
be 150 hours. However there is a possibility that some help from David
Leal and other personnel from the UK BSI/NAFEMS CAD/FE working group can
apply resources to create these modules.
