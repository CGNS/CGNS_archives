<h2>Meeting Minutes</h2>

12 January 2005<br>
7:00 PM Pacific Time

<p>
<ol>
<li> The meeting was called to order at 7:10 PM.
     There were <a href="#attendees">19 attendees</a>, listed below.
<p>
<li> The minutes of the 17 November 2004 meeting were approved as posted
     on the web site.
<p>
<li> Chair and Vice-Chair positions
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> The 2-year term for Chair expired.
          It was moved that Rumsey be reappointed as chair for a
          second term (Jan 2005 - Jan 2007).
          The motion carried.
     <li> A discussion was held on the need for a Vice-Chair position.
          The Vice-Chair would assist the Chair with his or her duties,
          with the expectation of taking over the Chair position when
          the current Chair's term expires.
          Members were encouraged to consider applying for this
          position; this subject will be further discussed at the next
          telecon.
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Status of previous action items:
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Towne will make changes in CGNS Charter document.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Done.
          </ol>
     <li> Hauser will check into parallel issues regarding
          time-dependent data.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Can do time-dependent fine in parallel as long as set
               total number of time steps up front
          <li> Need to discuss certain issues with HDF5 people.
               <u>Hauser will provide Rumsey a list of these.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Rumsey will circulate CGNS flyer to steering committee for
          comments.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Done. One-page flyer produced and distributed at Reno
               conference.
          </ol>
     <li> Poinot will work on completing SIDS-to-HDF5 documentation;
          Wedan, Rumsey, Towne, Koziol will be reviewers.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> In process.  Documentation currently under review.
               <u>Action item carries.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Michal will check with other Boeing people to see if they can
          test EM extension.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Not done yet.  <u>Action item carries.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Wedan will look into good way to implement the disabled
          chunk-search fix in ADF.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Done.  Change made permanent.  The only down side is that
               the storage temporarily doubles during the write, with a
               final slight (10%) increase in file size at the end.
          </ol>
     <li> Van der Weide will try deleting node and then writing (using
          ADF) on one of his big test cases and report back.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Done. No problems (no increase in file size) with this
               process.
          </ol>
     <li> Rumsey will send e-mail to CGNSTalk about testing HDF5 version
          of CGNS, and also will try to develop a list of what users there
          are and what platforms they have tested on.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Done. Only one response received. Discussion in HDF5
               section below.
          </ol>
     <li> Wedan and Wall will work out details about extensions &amp; get
          latest version in place for V2.4.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Done.
          </ol>
     <li> Rumsey will initiate documentation on new extensions; Wall and
          Towne will help.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> In process. <u>Action item carries.</u>
          </ol>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> ISO status/discussion:
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Status from Cosner (e-mail):
          <ol type=i>
          <li> No realistic prospect of regaining Boeing funding, and
               thus Boeing participation, for this project.  Authority
               to decide funding for ISO-STEP projects now rests
               with a Boeing org that is focused on CAD tools for
               mechanical/structural design.  They have no interest in
               development of a fluid dynamics standard.
          <li> ISO-STEP has decided to merge the draft CGNS-based fluids
               standard into the existing standard for finite element
               solid mechanics (AP 209), because there is a high degree
               of common content. Therefore, the standard will be
               discrete-element models for both fluids and solids.  This
               effort is being led by Keith Hunten of Lockheed Martin,
               Fort Worth.
          <li> The combined fluids-solids standard will be released in a
               new edition (update) of AP 209.  A release date has not
               been established, but it is unlikely to be in 2005.
          </ol>
     <li> Committee held brief discussion on compatibility of CGNS with
          the ISO version now that the ISO version may end up being
          radically different.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Will CGNS still achieve a certain level of compliance?
          <li> Does the committee need another "ISO representative" to
               keep track of the new developments?
          <li> Decision for now to try to keep communication lines open.
               <u>Rumsey to contact Keith Hunten of Lockheed Martin.</u>
          </ol>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Documentation issues and CGNStalk issues (Towne):
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Status of V2.3 becoming revised AIAA recommended practice
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Day and Cawley said most of our committee members have
               turned in their initial survey forms.  So far our
               committee is made up of: 4 from Government, 6 from
               Vendors, 7 from Users, and 2 from Academia. Day said that
               this balance is good (no one group has more than 50%),
               so there is no problem continuing with the balloting
               process. The ballots (voting to adopt latest SIDS version
               as AIAA recommended practice) will be e-mailed to
               steering committee members soon.
          </ol>
     <li> Updated documentation for V2.4beta (SIDS, SIDS-to-ADF, and
          MLL) is underway. <u>Towne will post changes for everyone to
          check. Poinot's new SIDS-to-HDF5 document will also need to
          eventually incorporate these changes.</u>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Software status/discussion (Wedan):
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> V2.4beta still has not been announced.  Wedan plans to make
          some additional changes and then officially announce it (also
          see discussion in HDF5 section below).
     </ol>
<p>
<li> HDF-5 status/discussion:
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Rumsey reported that Koziol (NCSA) e-mailed to say that they
          were planning to implement "creation order" tracking of
          objects in groups for the 1.8.0 release (due approximately
          in March 2005).  He also continues to work on speedup for
          the large number (thousands) of zones (which is still
          significantly slower than ADF).
     <li> Rumsey only received 1 response from users who tried the HDF5
          version.  The comments were:
          <ol type=i>
          <li> it is not backward compatible
          <li> the HDF5 version of the test files were 2-3 times larger
               than the ADF files
          </ol>
     <li> Discussion of these issues
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Backward compatibility should be easily overcome through
               converters between ADF and HDF5.  These converters
               already exist.  Software should be able to incorporate
               the converters.
          <li> The issue of larger HDF5 files was noticed by other
               people as well.  If only 1 zone, then the ADF and HDF5
               files are usually of similar size.  It is with many zones
               that they tend to be different. <u>Rumsey will contact
               Koziol to make him aware of this issue.</u>
          <li> To summarize, there appears to be 2 issues regarding
               HDF5 that are "worse" than with ADF files: first is
               excessively slow I/O when there are many (thousands) of
               zones; second is larger file sizes, even for "standard"
               files.
          </ol>
     <li> Discussion of switchover to HDF5
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Discussion about HDF5 two problems, and how they affect
               our switchover.
          <li> Creation ordering in CGNS can probably be thrown away.
          <li> <u>Wedan will make change in CGNS HDF5 software so viewer can
               read (see) character strings in the HDF5 files.</u>
          <li> IL is looking at compression issues.  Legensky plans to
               keep the committee informed about what they find.
          <li> With new version of HDF5, links are a lot faster.
          <li> Hauser currently has some parallel API calls, similar to
               partial read/writes just added by IL.
          <li> The (unchanged) <a href="#HDF5_todo">list of things to
               do/consider prior to HDF5 switchover</a> is included below.
          <li> Final decision of committee:
               <ol type=l>
               <li> Do not formally switchover to HDF5 yet.  We need to
                    resolve some of the performance and size issues first.
               <li> <u>V2.4beta will be modified by Wedan to include
                    HDF5 as an option (at compile time).</u> This beta
                    release can then undergo further testing.  We will
                    re-evaluate formal switchover date in the future.
               </ol>
          </ol>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Extensions status/discussion (Wall, Wedan):
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Fiedler (UIUC) made suggestion in CGNSTalk about allowing Rind
          for unstructured data. Apparently the change is easy.  <u>Wedan
          will look into the change and will contact Rumsey about it.</u>
          The change would also involve changes to the documentation.
     <li> Issue about polyhedral cells brought up. CGNS currently cannot
          handle them appropriately, and they are more and more in
          use by commercial CFD codes. It may fit under "N-gon", but
          additional info is needed (how ordered). <u>Michal will write a
          first draft proposal to handle polyhedral cells.</u>
     <li> Karman mentioned a needed capability for a particular
          unstructured type that is currently missing.  <u>He will write
          this up and send to Rumsey.</u>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Other issues:
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Review status of open items - deferred to a later meeting
     <li> CGNS user's meeting
          <ol type=i>
          <li> tentative time for this will be at Reno 2006
          <li> possibly have a short training session in one of the rooms
          <li> possibly use extra space in exhibit hall (booth?)
          <li> <u>Rumsey will look into these possibilities</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Next telecon: in roughly 2 months time
     <li> 3 CGNS-related papers were presented at this Reno meeting:
          2005-1381, 2005-1155, and 2005-0334.  <u>Hauser will send a PDF
          of his paper to Towne to post.</u> <u>Poinot will send a PDF of his
          paper to Towne to post.</u>  <u>Poinot will contact author of 0334
          (Iepan) to obtain PDF to send to Towne to post.</u>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Meeting was adjourned at 9:10 PM.
<p>
<li> Summary of <u><b>action items</b></u>:
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Hauser will provide Rumsey a list of issues that need to be
          discussed with the NCSA (HDF5) people.
     <li> Poinot will work on completing SIDS-to-HDF5 documentation;
          Wedan, Rumsey, Towne, Koziol will be reviewers. Will need
          to eventually incorporate new extensions (see (d)).
     <li> Michal will check with other Boeing people to see if they can
          test EM extension.
     <li> Towne will complete and post draft documentation on new
          extensions.
     <li> Rumsey will contact Keith Hunten of Lockheed Martin.
     <li> Rumsey will contact Koziol to make him aware of issue of larger
          size (factor 2-3) of HDF5 files.
     <li> Wedan will make change in CGNS HDF5 software so viewer can read
          (see) character strings in the HDF5 files.
     <li> Wedan will modify V2.4beta to include HDF5 as an option (at
          compile time), then will announce it.
     <li> Wedan will look into change required to allow Rind data for
          unstructured, and will contact Rumsey about it.
     <li> Michal will write a first draft proposal to handle polyhedral
          cells.
     <li> Karman will write up description of need for a particular
          unstructured type and send to Rumsey.
     <li> Rumsey will look into possibility for CGNS user's meeting in
          Reno 2006.
     <li> Hauser will send PDF of his CGNS Reno paper to Towne to post.
     <li> Poinot will send PDF of his CGNS Reno paper to Towne to post.
     <li> Poinot will obtain PDF of Iepan's CGNS Reno paper and will
          forward to Towne to post.
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Summary of <b><u>open items</u></b> from prior meetings (these are
     different from action items, in that they are open or unresolved
     issues that we want to keep track of, but there are no specific
     actions required of anyone at this point in time):
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> With V3.0 release, eliminate the <tt>Pointlist/Range</tt> +
          <tt>CellCenter</tt> possibility (and thus remove the need for
          <tt>GridLocation</tt> under <tt>BC_t</tt>).  Next major
          release of API will need to automatically make the
          alteration (transparent to the user). Documentation (SIDS,
          User's Guide, other?) will need to be changed.
     <li> Resolve <a href="#HDF5_todo">HDF-5 "to-do" list</a>.
     <li> Issue of 8 units - need consistency between
          <tt>DimensionalUnits</tt> and <tt>DimensionalExponents</tt>.
     <li> Eventually resolve any differences between SIDS and ISO/STEP.
     <li> Question of need (or preference) to have alphanumeric sorting
          of everything (like is currently done for zones)
     <li> Need for developing certification process (official test for
          compliance)
     </ol>

<h2>Tentative to-do list in association with HDF-5 switchover</h2>

<ul>
<li> Complete and test parallel implementation
<li> Complete and test API capability to automatically detect and switch
     between ADF and HDF-5 (transparent to user?)
<li> Assess/minimize impact on software vendors using CGNS
<li> Make changes recommended by HDF-5 to improve usability with HDF-5
     (e.g., character strings as opposed to character arrays)
<li> HDF-5 must fix "creation tracking"
<li> Assess compression capability of HDF-5
<li> Create SIDS-to-HDF-5 documentation (Poinot)
<li> CGNS configure scripts will need to be modified to check for
     availability of appropriate HDF-5 libraries.
<li> Possibly add flag-based options when opening CGNS files.  For
     example: "follow links" vs. "don't follow links"; "use ADF" vs. "use
     HDF-5"; "translate file automatically" vs. "leave the file as-is";
     "compress" vs. "don't compress".
<li> Look into eliminating need for ID's from MLL
</ul>
