<p>
Across the top of this figure are five boxes, labeled P00 through P04,
representing five processors.
Below that are three boxes stacked vertically, labeled from top to bottom
as:
<ul>
<li> parallel CGNS implementation
<li> parallel HDF
<li> MPI-I/O
</ul>
There are double-sided arrows between each of the five processor boxes
and the topmost of these three boxes, representing data flow in both
directions.
Across the bottom of the figure is a box labeled "Parallel File System".
There are five double-sided arrows between this box and the box above it
labeled "MPI-I/O", again representing data flow in both directions.
