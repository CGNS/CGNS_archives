<p>
This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the storage
of flow solution data in a CGNS file.
It shows the same node tree as described earlier 
<a href="fig2.html">illustrating the storage of grid coordinates</a>,
but with the addition, below the Cube node, of a flow solution node
named "Cube Solution", marked with a folder icon, and expanded.

<p>
Below the Cube Solution node are are nodes named "Density", "MomentumX",
"MomentumY", "MomentumZ", and "EnergyStagnationDensity", each marked
with a file icon.

<p>
In the node tree the Density node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Example/Cube/Cube Solution", the node name is Density, and the node
label is DataArray_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is R4, the dimensions
values are 5, 5, 5, and the bytes value is 500.
The density values are shown in the node data panel.
