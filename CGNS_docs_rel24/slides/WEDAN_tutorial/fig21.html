This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the
specification of a location for solution data.
It shows the same node tree as described in previous figures, with
the Cylinder Solution node expanded.

<p>
Below the Cylinder Solution node, in addition to the Density, MomentumX,
MomentumY, MomentumZ, and EnergyStagnationDensity nodes, a node named
"GridLocation" has been added.

<p>
In the node tree the Density node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Example/Cylinder/Cylinder Solution", the node name is Density, and the
node label is DataArray_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is R4, the dimensions
values are 4, 9, 4, and the bytes value is 676.
The density values are shown in the node data panel.
