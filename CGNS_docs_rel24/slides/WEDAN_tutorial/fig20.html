<p>
This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the
specification of a cylinder axis boundary.
It shows the same node tree as described in previous figures, but with
the addition of three boundary nodes below the "ZoneBC" for the Cylinder
zone node, named "Outflow", "Farfield", and "Axis", each marked with a
folder icon and expanded.

<p>
Below each of these nodes is a node named "PointRange", marked with a
file icon.
Also below the Outflow node is a node named "Outflow Conditions", marked
with a folder icon and expanded.
Below the Outflow Conditions node is a node named "NeumannData",
also marked with a folder icon and expanded.
Below the NeumannData node is a node named "PressureGradient", marked
with a file icon.

<p>
In the node tree the Axis node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Example/Cylinder/ZoneBC", the node name is Axis, and the node label
is BC_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is C1, the dimensions
value is 16, and the bytes value is 16.
The string "BCDegenerateLine" is shown in the node data panel.
