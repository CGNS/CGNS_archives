This is an image of the
<a href="../../cgnstools/adfviewer/index.html">ADFviewer</a> main window.
The window is divided into several areas, or panels.

<p>
Along the top are the menu items, followed by a series of toolbar
buttons.
Below these, on the left is the expandable/collapsible node tree.
On the right, from top to bottom, are the node description, link
description, and data description panels, a row of node-related buttons,
and the node data panel.

<p>
At the top of the node tree is the root node of the ADF file, named
simply "/", and shown with a folder icon.
The next line is the "CGNSLibraryVersion" node, marked with a file icon.

<p>
Next is the base node for the CGNS database, named "Base" and marked
with a folder icon.
The left is a "-" sign, indicating that the Basename node has been
expanded, and clicking the "-" sign will collapse it.

<p>
Below the Base node are the following nodes, with the names indicated.

<ul>
<li> "Zone 1", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "InputFileUsed 1", marked with a file icon
<li> "SimulationType", marked with a file icon
<li> "GlobalConvergenceHistory", marked with a folder icon, and
     collapsed
<li> "DataClass", marked with a file icon
<li> "ReferenceState", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed

<li> "CFL3DTimeStep", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "InputFileUsed 2", marked with a file icon
<li> "Case Title", marked with a file icon
</ul>

<p>
In the node tree the Zone 1 node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is "/Base",
the node name is Zone 1, and the node label is Zone_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is I4, the dimensions
values are 3 and 3, and the bytes value is 16.
