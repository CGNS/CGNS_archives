This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the storage
of reference state data in a CGNS file.
It shows the same node tree as described earlier for a
<a href="fig2.html">typical view of a CGNS file</a>, but with the
ReferenceState node expanded.

<p>
Below the ReferenceState node are the following nodes.
<ul>
<li> "ReferenceStateDescription", marked with a file icon
<li> "Mach", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "Mach_Velocity", marked with a file icon
<li> "Mach_VelocitySound", marked with a file icon
<li> "Reynolds", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "Reynolds_Velocity", marked with a file icon
<li> "Reynolds_Length", marked with a file icon
<li> "Reynolds_ViscosityKinematic", marked with a file icon
<li> "Temperature", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "AngleofAttack", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "AngleofYaw", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "Density", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "VelocitySound", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "ViscosityMolecular", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "ViscosityMolecularCFL3D", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "LengthReference", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "Pressure", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "VelocityX", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "VelocityY", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "VelocityZ", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
</ul>
There are additional nodes below the ReferenceState node, not
currently visible, as indicated by the scroll bar to the right of the
node tree panel.

<p>
In the node tree the Reynolds node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Base/ReferenceState", the node name is Reynolds, and the node label is
DataArray_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is R8, the dimensions
value is 1, and the bytes value is 8.
The Reynolds number is shown in the node data panel.
