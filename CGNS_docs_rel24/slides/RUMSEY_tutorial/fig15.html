<p>
This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the storage
of grid coordinates in a CGNS file.
It shows the same node tree as described earlier for the
<a href="fig6.html">figure illustrating the storage of boundary
condition information in a CGNS file</a> but with the GridCoordinates
node expanded instead of the ZoneBC node.

<p>
Below the GridCoordinates node are the following nodes, all marked with a
file icon.
<ul>
<li> "CoordinateX"
<li> "CoordinateY"
<li> "CoordinateZ"
</ul>

<p>
In the node tree the CoordinateX node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Base/Zone 1/GridCoordinates", the node name is CoordinateX, and the
node label is DataArray_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is R8, the dimensions
values are 21, 17, and 9, and the bytes value is 25704.
The x grid coordinate values are shown in the node data panel.
