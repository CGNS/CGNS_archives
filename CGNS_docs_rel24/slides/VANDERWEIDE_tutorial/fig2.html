<p>
This is an image of the
<a href="../../cgnstools/adfviewer/index.html">ADFviewer</a> main window,
and shows the structure of a CGNS file for an example unstructured grid.
The window is divided into several areas, or panels.

<p>
Along the top are the menu items, followed by a series of toolbar
buttons.
Below these, on the left is the expandable/collapsible node tree.
On the right, from top to bottom, are the node description, link
description, and data description panels, a row of node-related buttons,
and the node data panel.

<p>
At the top of the node tree is the root node of the ADF file, named
simply "/", and shown with a folder icon.
The next line is the "CGNSLibraryVersion" node, marked with a file icon.

<p>
Next is the base node for the CGNS database, named "Base" and marked
with a folder icon.
The left is a "-" sign, indicating that the Basename node has been
expanded, and clicking the "-" sign will collapse it.

<p>
Below the Base node are nodes named "Wing", "SymmetryPlane", and
"Farfield", each marked with a folder icon and expanded.
Below each of these nodes is a node named "FamilyBC", marked with a file
icon.

<p>
Also below the Base node is a node named "Main", marked with a folder
icon and expanded.
Below the Main node are the following nodes, with the names indicated.
<ul>
<li> "ZoneType", marked with a file icon.
<li> "GridCoordinates", marked with a folder icon, and expanded.  Below
     this node are nodes named "CoordinateX", "CoordinateY", and
     "CoordinateZ", each marked with a file icon.
<li> Nodes named "Prisms", "Pyramids", "Tetrahedra", "Quadrilaterals",
     and "Triangles", each marked with a folder icon and expanded.
     Below each of these nodes are nodes named "ElementRange" and
     "ElementConnectivity", each marked with a file icon.
</ul>

<p>
Also below the Main node is a node named "ZoneBC", marked with a folder
icon and expanded.
Below the ZoneBC node are nodes named "Quads_SymmetryPlane",
"Trias_Wing", "Trias_SymmetryPlane", and "Trias_Farfield", each marked
with a folder icon and expanded.
Below each of these nodes are nodes named "ElementList" and
"FamilyName", each marked with a file icon.

<p>
In the node tree the Tetrahedra node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Base/Main", the node name is Tetrahedra, and the node label is
Elements_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is I4, the dimensions
value is 2, and the bytes value is 8.
The values are shown in the node data panel.
