This figure shows some of the unstructured grid elements supported by
CGNS, as follows.
<ul>
<li> TRI_3 - Two-dimensional triangular element, with three nodes
     located at the three geometric corners of the triangle.
<li> QUAD_4 - Two-dimensional quadrilateral element, with four nodes
     located at the four geometric corners of the quadrangle.
<li> TETRA_4 - Three-dimensional tetrahedral element, with four nodes
     located at the four geometric corners of the tetrahedron.
<li> PYRA_5 - Three-dimensional pyramid element, with five nodes
     located at the five geometric corners of the pyramid.
<li> PENTA_6 - Three-dimensional pentahedral element, with six nodes
     located at the six geometric corners of the pentahedron.
<li> HEXA_8 - Three-dimensional hexahedral element, with eight nodes
     located at the eight geometric corners of the hexahedron.
</ul>
