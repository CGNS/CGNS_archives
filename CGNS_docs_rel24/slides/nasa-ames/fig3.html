This diagram illustrates the structure of an ADF file, including a link
node to another file.
Two tree structures are shown, one labeled ADF File #1, and the other
labeled ADF File #2.
Each has a box labeled Root at the top, representing the root node in
the file.

<p>
In ADF File #1, below the Root node are nodes labeled N1, L1, and N2.
In turn, node N1 has child nodes labeled N3 and N4, and node N2 has
child nodes labeled N5, N6, and L2.

<p>
In ADF File #2, below the Root node are nodes labeled F1, F2, and F3.
Node F3 has child nodes labeled F4 and F5.

<p>
In ADF File #1, the node L1 has an arrow directed toward node N5,
indicating that L1 is a link to node N5 in the same file.
Node L2 has an arrow directed toward node F4 in ADF File #2, indicating
that L2 is a link to node F4 in ADF File #2.
