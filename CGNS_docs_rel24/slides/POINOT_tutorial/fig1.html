This diagram illustrates the communication paths used with pyCGNS.

<p>
On the right is the end-user Python script.
It creates the Python/CGNS tree (i.e., file) in memory, and communicates
with pyCGNS.
Other user applications, such as a numeric process or MPI, may also make
use of the Python/CGNS tree.

<p>
pyCGNS uses the CGNS Mid-Level Library to create an in-memory version of
its own version of the tree.
Using ADF (or HDF5) the Mid-Level Library also creates the actual CGNS
file.

<p>
The logical data model (i.e., the SIDS) is unchanged.
