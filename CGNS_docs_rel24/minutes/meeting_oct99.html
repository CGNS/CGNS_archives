<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Meeting Minutes</h2>

14-15 October 1999<br>
United Technologies Research Center<br>
East Hartford, Connecticut

<p>
The first CGNS Steering committee meeting was held 14-15 October 1999
in Hartford, CT. This committee is responsible for supporting the CGNS
CFD data standard, after the end of the NASA/Boeing contract effort to
develop the standard. The main objective of this first meeting was to
adopt a charter and to plan the next steps for the organization. The
meeting minutes are followed by a list of <a href="#action">action
items</a>.

<p>
There were 17 attendees, <a href="#attendees">listed below</a>.

<ul>
<li> <b>Attendee Comments</b>
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> Ed Hall: suggests encouraging the universities to use CGNS.
          Has implemented CGNS in ADPAC.
     <li> Ray Cosner: Boeing has more aggressive plans regarding CGNS
          for the year 2000.
     <li> Francis Enomoto: IT is probably interested.
     <li> Todd Michal: Will soon have a full implementation of CGNS in
          WIND. The next step is to add it to all the supporting tools.
     <li> Dan Dominik: Boeing Reusable Space Systems has reviewed CGNS
          and decided to proceed with it.
     <li> Chris Rumsey: Version 6 of CFL3D supports CGNS.
     </ul>
<br>
<li> <b>Outreach Team</b> - report by Barbara Hutchings (Fluent)
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> Phase I: prime players with focus on commercial
          companies: Fluent, CD, ICEM CFD, Pointwise (Gridgen), CEI
          (Ensight), Intelligent Light (FieldView)
     <li> Phase II: focus on other end-user organizations (CFD, CAE,
          CAD vendors)
          <ul>
          <li> CGNS needs to support CFD CAE connections. Add material
               properties, etc.
          </ul>
     </ul>
<br>
<li> <b>Charter Team</b> - report by Bob Bush (UTRC)
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> CGNS will officially adhere to GNU licensing requirements
     <li> GNU license will be on the internet, prior to downloading
          users have to click "OK"
     <li> CGNS membership will be limited to 15 or fewer organizations
          at the discretion of the Steering Committee.
          <ul>
          <li> If size becomes an issue, we may limit membership to
               one representative from each organization i.e., "NASA"
               only needs one representative rather than one from each
               research center
          <li> Membership changes will be approved by the Steering
               Committee
          <li> We must leave the door opened for members of the
               automotive industry.
          </ul>
     <li> Technical Support Subcommittee (Documentation Committee)
          <ul>
          <li> The purpose of this committee is to take new proposals
               and put them in proper SIDS and ADF-File-Mapping
               format. The persons submitting proposals are not
               held responsible to present them in the SIDS and
               ADF-File-Mapping format.
          </ul>
     <li> The issue of whether a secretary is needed will be left up to
          the discretion of the chairperson.
     <li> Add ADAPCO to the steering committee
     <li> Contact DASA-MTU (see if they really want to be on the
          steering committee)
     </ul>
<br>
<li> <b>Chairperson election</b>
     <p>
     Bob Bush (UTRC) unanimously selected chairperson
<br><br>
<li> <b>CAPRI</b> - report by Bob Haimes, (MIT)
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> motivated by NPSS (NASA Glenn)
     <li> tying into many existing CAD packages
     <li> sees CAPRI as natural tie-in to CGNS, and NPSS is interested.
     <li> doesn't know if CAPRI will be free yet
     </ul>
<br>
<li> <b>Position Discussions</b> - report by Ray Cosner (Boeing)
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> ISO (discussion of process and current status)
          <ul>
          <li> Boeing initiative. First presented at an ISO meeting in
               January 1999.
          <li> 200 CGNS registered users over 28 countries, as of
               9/1/99.  But only 6 of the 17 ISO P-Member countries are
               currently supporting CGNS.
          <li> Steps in the ISO certification process:
               <ul type=disc>
               <li> Translating SIDS into EXPRESS language. Almost
                    completed.
               <li> Nov.12, 1999: Lobby for PWI Support. Needs and has
                    the support of five ISO P-Member countries.
               <li> May 2000: Obtain NWI Approval: needs 2/3 of the
                    voting countries.
               <li> Subcommittee to prepare the Draft International
                    Standard during year 2000.
               <li> Several revisions are expected
               <li> Earliest possible ISO acceptance: November 2001, but
                    2002 or even 2003 are more realistic dates.
               </ul>
          <li> The wind tunnel and flight test capability will be added
               later by amendment.
          <li> The main stumbling block is to identify potential
               overseas supporters from the "P-membership" list
          </ul>
     <br>
     <li> AIAA subcommittee on standards
          <ul>
          <li> potential home for CGNS
          <li> AIAA is excited by the prospect
          <li> existing committee members don't want to increase their
               workload
          <li> The AIAA Committee on Standards would form a 4th
               sub-committee for CGNS and let the CGNS team operate
               autonomously.
          <li> we voted "YES" to this idea and to think about what does
               the CGNS team want from AIAA
          </ul>
     </ul>
<br>
<li> <b>Funding and Maintenance discussion</b>
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> need money for tech support, software, upgrading API, etc.
          10-20K per year from each org? Is this possible? most money
          needed next 4 years or so, then could taper off
     <li> we need to write "white papers"
     <li> ICEM: may need as much as 2 F.T.E.'s for next few years! this
          translates to 300K per yr! -a lot to do!
     <li> need to draft a list of specific items that require funding.
          Do this at end of this meeting and present at next CGNS
          meeting at Reno 2000 (one evening) (Bush)
     <li> perhaps should hold a USERS meeting at summer 2000 AIAA meeting
     <li> can we put a plug (write article) for Aerospace America?
     <li> SIDS changes could be partly funded by the Boeing ISO project.
     <li> possible funding sources:(?) NIST, NPSS, IT, DOE
     </ul>
<br>
<li> <b>Proposal for SIDS extensions</b> - report by Bob Bush (UTRC)
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> how do we adopt these?
     <li> action: everyone on team to look at proposed extensions on the
          web site by the end of the month - send comments about them
     <li> we can vote via e-mail
     <li> should also send e-mail to all registered users telling them
          that it's their last chance to send their comments about the
          proposed extensions
     <li> any changes shouldn't alter existing API functions.  If a
          change is needed, write a new function, but still support the
          old one for backward compatibility (perhaps gradually phase it
          out)
     <li> have a "beta" release before making changes "official"?
     <li> should this CGNS team hold telecons? RECOMMENDATION:
          bi-monthly - Bob to look into it
     <li> web site should post all new SIDS extension proposals as
          they come in
     <li> Need to develop a draft of actual process for adding
          extensions, and post this process on the web (Doug McCarthy)
     </ul>
<br>
<li> <b>Logo report</b>
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> it's been on the web site long enough - should probably
          come off
     <li> team "seemed" to agree on some sort of swan logo
     <li> Theresa Babrauckas (NASA) will try to refine the logo for
          final recommendation
     </ul>
<br>
<li> <b>Award report</b>
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> Recognized for their outstanding contribution to the CGNS
          project: Thomas Dickens (Boeing), Wayne Jones (Boeing), Matt
          Smith (Boeing), Steve Allmaras (Boeing), Theresa Babrauckas
          (NASA Glenn), Christopher Rumsey (NASA Langley), Francis
          Enomoto (NASA Ames), Mike George (NASA Ames), Ben Paul
          (Boeing), Armin Wulf (ICEM CFD Engineering), Ray Cosner
          (Boeing), and Doug McCarthy (Boeing).
     <li> Diane Poirier (ICEM CFD Engineering) was given an award for
          her outstanding service to the CGNS team.
     <li> Theresa Babrauckas gets "best unabashed performance in a
          crowded restaurant" award for her bold rendition of "I Could
          Have Danced All Night" at the Thursday evening dinner
     </ul>
<br>

     <li> Extensions
          <ul>
          <li> necessary changes to new proposals, (esp. relating to
               "point-by-point" grid motion)
               <ul type=disc>
               <li> need to allow for multiple <tt>GridCoordinates_t</tt>
                    nodes
               <li> default is the one named "<tt>GridCoordinates</tt>"
               <li> new API calls are needed relating to reading
                    grid, (old call can still default to reading
                    "default" grid) then point-by-point will be easier,
                    w/o having to use multiple bases (can employ a
                    <tt>GridCoordinateConnections</tt> under
                    <tt>TimeLevels_t</tt>)

          <li> need to be able to handle Cartesian grids? (Octree)
               <ul type=disc>
               <li> Diane Poirier will work with M. Aftosmis to prepar
                    a proposal
               </ul>
          <li> Add API function to be able to create an arbitrary node,
               and improve the <tt>cg_goto</tt> function to be able to
               go to these arbitrary nodes.
          <li> Add support to periodic boundary conditions.
          <li> Create an API function to write to disk in case the
               solver bombs.
          </ul>
     <br>

          <li> SIDS needs to be updated to include all the new features
          <li> documents should be available in the pdf format
          <li> need User Manual/Tutorial
          <li> CGNS API documentation needs to be printable (pdf)
          </ul>

     <li> Training
     <br><br>
     <li> Web maintenance
     <br><br>
     <li> User support
          <ul>
          <li> This effort is expected to grow rapidly in the next few
