          <li> done; definition is now in latest SIDS documentation
          </ul>
     <li> Towne will check to see if the settings in CGNSTalk can be
          changed so replies automatically go to CGNSTalk
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> done
          </ul>

          <ul type=disc>
          <li> in progress; <u>Wedan, Rumsey, Towne, Koziol agreed to be
               reviewers</u>

               forward soon with the extensions without Boeing testing
          </ul>
     <li> Wall will look into possibility of filling in unwritten
          portions of array with NaN's for partial read/write extension,
          and will work with Wedan to prepare all extensions for
          release.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> decided changes would be too extensive; staying with
               default of zeros for unwritten portions, with user
               responsible for keeping track
          </ul>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> ISO status/discussion:
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> No change from last report
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Documentation issues and CGNStalk issues (Towne):
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Status of V2.3 becoming revised AIAA recommended practice
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Day and Cawley discussed balloting process - changed
               from 2 years ago
          <li> committee needs to be balanced among "interest categories"
          <li> decided on Government, Academia, Industry (tool vendor),
               and Industry (user)
          <li> first step will be to e-mail the committee members and
               have them fill out which category they belong to
          <li> ballot on recommended practice will occur after that
               (possibly in January)
          </ol>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Software status/discussion (Wedan):
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> As part of Alonso and Van der Weide's discovery of slowness
          writing files with huge numbers of blocks, Wedan found a major
          cause in ADF: software doing "chunk search" to try to use up
          empty spaces in the file.  By disabling this search, write
          times dramatically improved (e.g., 15 min -> 20 sec) for the
          big files. Downside is that file size could increase. <u>Wedan
          will look into good way to implement this fix.</u>
     <li> Wedan said that it appears that if you delete a node in ADF,
          then write out the file, it rewrites everything. <u>Van der
          Weide agreed to try this on one of his big test cases and
          report back.</u> Koziol said that HDF-5 does not do this.
     </ol>
<p>
<li> HDF-5 status/discussion:
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> HDF-5 task force has been active, pursuing issue uncovered
          by Alonso and Van der Weide (slow writing of files with huge
          numbers of blocks, 1000 or more).  Wedan found a fix for ADF,
          but HDF-5 is still too slow.  Koziol is working with Alonso
          and Van der Weide looking into the issue.
     <li> Poinot uses HDF-5 version of CGNS regularly, and has no
          problems (but he does not employ so many blocks).
     <li> Discussion of switchover to HDF-5
          <ol type=i>
          <li> we need more people to try the HDF-5 version prior to
               Reno meeting; <u>Rumsey will send e-mail to CGNSTalk
               about it, and also will try to develop a list of what
               users there are and what platforms they have tested
               on.</u>
          <li> it is also important that software vendors be a part of
               the beta process
          <li> Koziol mentioned that HDF-5 is funded and committed for
               long-term; unlikely to be major changes (i.e., no HDF-6)
          <li> further discussion and decision on switchover to take
               place at Reno meeting
          </ol>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Extensions status/discussion (Wall, Wedan):
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Version 2.4 (Beta) will be cut sometime soon; this version
          includes the latest IL extensions
          <ol type=i>
          <li> <u>Wedan and Wall will work out details &amp; get latest
               version of extensions in place</u>
          <li> <u>Rumsey will initiate documentation on new extensions;
               Wall and Towne will help</u>
          </ol>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Other issues:
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Review status of open items
          <ol type=i>
          <li> links causing slowdown is no longer a major problem
               (remove item)
          <li> Eliminate <tt>PointList/Range</tt> + <tt>CellCenter</tt>
               possibility: will be done for V3.0, not before
          <li> <a href="#HDF5_todo">HDF-5 "to do" list</a> - still open
          <li> Issue of 8 units - still an issue
          <li> Resolve SIDS and ISO/STEP - still an issue
          <li> alphanumeric sorting of everything - would be useful, but
               still needs looking into
          <li> certification process - Poinot's upcoming Reno paper
               addresses this (uses XML grammar)
          </ol>
     <li> Need for CGNS user's meeting - to be discussed at Reno
     <li> Wedan to talk about CGNS at Computational Electromagnetics
          meeting at NASA Ames early in 2005
     <li> Next meeting: face-to-face at Reno, Wed Jan 12, 7PM, room TBD
     <li> Election of chairperson will be held at Reno meeting; anyone
          interested in the position should contact Rumsey
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Meeting was adjourned at 12:25 PM.
<p>
<li> Summary of <b><u>action items</u></b>:
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Towne will make changes in CGNS Charter document.
     <li> Hauser will check into parallel issues regarding
          time-dependent data.
     <li> Rumsey will circulate CGNS flyer to steering committee for
          comments.
     <li> Poinot will work on completing SIDS-to-HDF5 documentation;
          Wedan, Rumsey, Towne, Koziol will be reviewers.
     <li> Michal will check with other Boeing people to see if they can
          test EM extension.
     <li> Wedan will look into good way to implement the disabled
          chunk-search fix in ADF.
     <li> Van der Weide will try deleting node and then writing (using
          ADF) on one of his big test cases and report back.
     <li> Rumsey will send e-mail to CGNSTalk about testing HDF-5
          version of CGNS, and also will try to develop a list of what
          users there are and what platforms they have tested on.
     <li> Wedan and Wall will work out details about extensions &amp;
          get latest version in place for V2.4.
     <li> Rumsey will initiate documentation on new extensions; Wall
          and Towne will help.
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Summary of <b><u>open items</u></b> from prior meetings (these are
     different from action items, in that they are open or unresolved
     issues that we want to keep track of, but there are no specific
     actions required of anyone at this point in time):
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> With V3.0 release, eliminate the <tt>Pointlist/Range</tt> +
          <tt>CellCenter</tt> possibility (and thus remove the need for
          <tt>GridLocation</tt> under <tt>BC_t</tt>).  Next major
          release of API will need to automatically make the
          alteration (transparent to the user). Documentation (SIDS,
          User's Guide, other?) will need to be changed.
     <li> Resolve <a href="#HDF5_todo">HDF-5 "to-do" list</a>.
     <li> Issue of 8 units - need consistency between
          <tt>DimensionalUnits</tt> and <tt>DimensionalExponents</tt>.
     <li> Eventually resolve any differences between SIDS and ISO/STEP.
     <li> Question of need (or preference) to have alphanumeric sorting
          of everything (like is currently done for zones)
     <li> Need for developing certification process (official test for
          compliance)
     </ol>

<a name="HDF5_todo"></a>
<h2>Tentative to-do list in association with HDF-5 switchover</h2>

<ul>
<li> Complete and test parallel implementation
<li> Complete and test API capability to automatically detect and switch
     between ADF and HDF-5 (transparent to user?)
<li> Assess/minimize impact on software vendors using CGNS
<li> Make changes recommended by HDF-5 to improve usability with HDF-5
     (e.g., character strings as opposed to character arrays)
<li> HDF-5 must fix "creation tracking"
<li> Assess compression capability of HDF-5
<li> Create SIDS-to-HDF-5 documentation (Poinot)
<li> CGNS configure scripts will need to be modified to check for
     availability of appropriate HDF-5 libraries.
<li> Possibly add flag-based options when opening CGNS files.  For
     example: "follow links" vs. "don't follow links"; "use ADF" vs. "use
     HDF-5"; "translate file automatically" vs. "leave the file as-is";
     "compress" vs. "don't compress".
<li> Look into eliminating need for ID's from MLL
</ul>
