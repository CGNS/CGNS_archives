<h2>Meeting Minutes</h2>

7 January 2004<br>
7:00 PM Pacific Time<br><br>

<ol>
<li> The meeting was called to order at 7:05 PM.
     There were <a href="#attendees">17 attendees</a>, listed below.
<br><br>
<li> The minutes of the 20 November 2004 telecon meeting were reviewed
     and approved as posted on the web site.
<br><br>
<li> Status of previous action items:
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Check in latest HDF-5 software to SourceForge (Wedan):
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> A version was posted to SourceForge earlier, but Bruce
               has since worked on it more. <u>The latest version will
               be posted to SourceForge (under CVS) soon</u>, after
               Marc Poinot has had a chance to look at it.  It can do
               links OK now.  It is basically complete, although Bruce
               identified a bug in the HDF-5 software, which he reported
               to them.
          </ul>
     <li> Add home page to SourceForge (Wedan):
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Done.
          </ul>
     <li> Proposal for reinstating removed element list and range (Wedan):
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Committee decided to reinstate this without formal
               proposal review, as of official release of Version
               2.3 (see #7 below). <u>Rumsey to check with Towne to
               see if SIDS documentation exists for this capability
               already.</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Problem with ADF children's IDs between 2.2 and 2.3 (Poinot, Wedan)
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Resolved.
          </ul>
     <li> Experiment with disk block size (Alonso, van der Weide)
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> 4096 = standard
          <li> Biggest speed-up was maybe 25%, usually it was 5-10%
          <li> Decided to leave as-is; maintains backward compatibility
          </ul>
     <li> Do links cause slowdown? (Alonso, van der Weide)
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Yes, when many linked nodes are present
          <li> Problem is number of zones in link - there are a lot of
               links to <tt>GridCoordinates</tt> when there are a lot of
               zones - when you open the file, it goes through all the
               tree
          <li> <u>Bruce will look into this issue further (perhaps can
               modify open call so it does not follow links).</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Prepare/prioritize extensions (Bush, Rumsey)
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Done (discussion later)
          </ul>
     <li> Post charter for comments (Rumsey, Edwards):
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Done (discussion later)
          </ul>
     <li> Proposal for partial read/write posted to website (van der Weide):
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Done.
          </ul>
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Charter (Rumsey)
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Only 2 minor comments were made via e-mail during the last 2
          months.
     <li> Vote was taken, charter was accepted.
     <li> <u>Rumsey will finalize and send to Towne to post.</u>
     </ol>
<br>
<li> ISO status/discussion (Cosner):
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Rumsey reported for Cosner: no formal change of status.
          Boeing funding for 2004 remains unresolved.  With regard
          to parts 52, 53, and 110, Ray has received several formal
          comments from several countries, but they are low-level and
          easily addressed.
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Documentation issues and CGNStalk issues (Towne):
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Rumsey reported for Towne: for the updated AIAA recommended
          practice, AIAA will send a ballot to the CGNS committee
          sometime soon. <tt>ElementList</tt> and <tt>Range</tt> will
          need to be added into the SIDS when that functionality is
          turned back on (see #7 below).  Regarding spam problem on
          CGNSTalk, it is not bad enough yet to warrant any action.
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Software status/discussion (Wedan):
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Discussion took place about releasing CGNS V2.3 (removing from
          beta status).  This was formally voted on and accepted by the
          committee.
     <li> It was also decided to put back in the <tt>ElementList</tt>
          and <tt>Range</tt> capability, but this will require
          modification to the SIDS.
     <li> <u>Bruce will prepare V2.3 for official release - need to
          coordinate with change to SIDS for <tt>ElementList</tt> and
          <tt>Range</tt>.</u>
     <li> <u>Bruce will look into formally archiving all old versions of
          the software.</u>
     <li> <u>Bruce will remove the webpage containing binaries - in the
          future, all software must be obtained through SourceForge.</u>
     </ol>
<br>
<li> HDF-5 status/discussion (Poinot, Wedan, Power): 
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Thomas Hauser described his work (Reno AIAA paper 2004-1088)
          regarding CGNS with HDF-5 for parallel (created new calls in
          API) - a start, still needs more work.
     <li> Power, Alonso, agreed to help test new software.
     <li> Edwards and Hauser will coordinate their efforts in this area.
     <li> At some point, Bruce will put preliminary version of Hauser's
          software on SourceForge.
     <li> Noted that HDF-5 is slower than ADF for small files (&lt;
          roughly 1 million points).  The file size is also bigger.
     <li> Committee decided that it is still too early to officially
          switch over to HDF-5 (from ADF).  We will work toward it.
          When we go, it will be a "major" release (3.0).
     <li> There is already a translator ADF -&gt; HDF-5 available.
          When we go to V3.0, it should probably automatically make
          the translation for the user (in much the same way that the
          current software automatically upgrades earlier versions to
          the latest).
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Extensions status/discussion (Bush, Rumsey)
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Extensions were discussed and
          <a href="#extensions">prioritized</a>, regarding possibility
          for immediate implementation by Intelligent Light (as part
          of their SBIR contract). <u>Rumsey to send a summary to
          Edwards.</u>
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Other issues:
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Poinot plans to submit a proposal relating to SIDS changes
          needed in conjunction with an XML CGNS "compiler" he has been
          developing.
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Meeting was adjourned at 9:15 PM.
<br><br>
<li> Summary of action items:
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Wedan to post latest and greatest HDF-5 version (including
          link capability) to SourceForge.
     <li> Rumsey to check with Towne to see if documentation still
          exists for <tt>ElementList</tt> and <tt>Range</tt> (removed
          prior to V2).
     <li> Wedan will look into issue of links further (perhaps can
          modify open call so it does not follow links).
     <li> Rumsey will finalize updated CGNS Charter and send to Towne to
          post.
     <li> Wedan will prepare V2.3 for official release - need to
          coordinate with change to SIDS for <tt>ElementList</tt> and
          <tt>Range</tt>.
     <li> Wedan will look into formally archiving all old versions of
          the software.
     <li> Wedan will remove the webpage containing binaries - in the
          future, all software must be obtained through SourceForge.
     <li> Rumsey to send a summary of priority list of Proposals for
          Extension to Edwards.

<h2>Prioritization of Proposals for Extension</h2>

<tr valign=baseline>
   <td>6) New BC types
   <td align=center>L
   <td align=center>Y

<tr valign=baseline>
   <td>7) &amp; 9) Elements/Chemistry

<tr valign=baseline>
   <td>8) Regions
   <td align=center>L
   <td align=center>Y
   <td>Important, but need to add similar capability for Structured also
       (in consistent fashion)
<tr valign=baseline>
   <td>10) Soln specific BCs
   <td align=center>L

   <td align=center>L
   <td align=center>Y
   <td>Important, but not ready yet

   <td>13) Hierarchical
   <td align=center>L
   <td align=center>Y
   <td>Important, but not ready yet
</table>

<p>
Note: low (L) priority does not indicate low value of proposal - the
rating is primarily relating to readiness for immediate implementation,
as well as need for the capability by the greatest number of users.
