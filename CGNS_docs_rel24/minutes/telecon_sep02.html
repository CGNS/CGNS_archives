<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Telecon Minutes</h2>

18 September 2002<br>
2:00pm Eastern Time<br><br>

Telecon Number: (805) 240-9853, participant code: 557184

<p>
The meeting was called to order with 10 people in attendance.
The <a href="#attendees">attendees</a> are listed below.

<p>
The minutes of the June Meeting in St. Louis were approved as posted on
the web.

<ul>
<li> <b>Charter Business</b> - Bob Bush extended an invitation for
     nominations and volunteers for people to serve as chairman of the
     Steering Committee beginning next year.
     The duties include arranging meetings and telecons, setting
     agendas, serving as a focal point for questions about the
     standard and organization, coordinating the review, approval and
     implementation of extensions and generally keeping the lines of
     communication open.
     Anyone interested should contact Bob Bush
     (<a href="mailto:bushrh@pweh.com">bushrh@pweh.com</a>) by the
     end of September.
<br><br>
<li> <b>ISO Status</b> - Ray Cosner indicated that there have been no
     meetings of the ISO committee since the June meeting.
     Parts 52 an 53 are complete and ready for release.
     They are available for review on the
     CGNS web site.
     Part 110 has been incorporated into Part 237 and which is still
     being revised.
     There is still a plan to have a workshop to review the parts once
     237 is in draft form, probably towards the end of the year.
     Ray will try to provide one month notice to the committee of the
     arrangements.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Documentation</b> - Charlie Towne indicated that the Library of
     Congress number for the AIAA Recommended Practice has arrived and
     final arrangements are being made to finalize the document.
     He is now working on revising the beta document to include new
     extensions currently being implemented.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Extensions</b> - Diane Poirier reported on the status of
     extensions currently being implemented, including Delete Node,
     Gravity, Axisymmetry, Rotating Coordinates, Periodic Connectivity
     and Rotor/Stator interactions.
     These will be released as Version 2.2 as soon as the beta
     documentation has been updated.

     There was some discussion about forward compatibility.
     We will allow forward compatibility for point releases, and
     reserve changes that are not forward compatible for integer level
     revisions.
     This should alleviate much of the vendor support issues.
     The change has been implemented in V2.1 and will be supported in
     subsequent revisions.
     We have also made a Rev release of V2.0 in case vendors would like
     this capability, but do not want to upgrade to V2.1.
     Charlie Towne asked if we could pass back an error code instead of
     stopping the read, but this would be difficult to implement.
     We will continue to study this issue.

     Marc Poinot has indicated that he has a full implementation of the
     SIDS using HDF5 instead of the ADF core, with the notable exception
     of support for Links.
     Revisions to HDF5 should facilitate adding Link capability also.
     Marc has not had time to do performance comparisons between HDF
     and ADF implementations, and ONERA is still using ADF for their
     applications.
     David Edwards indicated a willingness to do some benchmarking and
     comparisons.
     <br><br>
<li> <b>Related Software Status</b> - Chris Rumsey will review the
     utilities and documentation provided by Bruce Wedan, and see what
     we can provide in the way of documentation.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Issues</b> - There was some discussion about bug tracking
     to provide additional user information about the status of the
     software.
     There are free software products out there, but there being no
     known bugs we will wait to implement a bug tracking system.

     John Bussoletti would like to see some re-structuring of the
     mid-level libraries to better support unstructured grids, new
     programming capabilities and perhaps isolate ADF from the SIDS and
     mid level library implementation.
     He also indicated a desire for the addition of unstructured edge
     definition to the SIDS.
     The committee invited him to write extensions for the SIDS, and to
     recommend changes to the mid level library.
     A bottom up re-write of the mid level library would be welcomed,
     but the committee does not currently have the resources to support
     such an activity.

     Chris Rumsey indicated the continuing need for a diff function to
     compare binary files.
     The time stamp difficulty, and the indeterminate node structure
     were cited as difficulties that would need to be overcome.
     This also led to a discussion of the need for a SIDS compliance
     checker, perhaps built into the Utilities.
