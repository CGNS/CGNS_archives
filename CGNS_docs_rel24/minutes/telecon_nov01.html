<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Telecon Minutes</h2>

6 November 2001<br>
2:00pm Eastern Time<br><br>

Telecon Number: (954) 797-1657, participant code: 995403

<p>
The meeting was called to order at 2:00pm.
There were 16 attendees, as <a href="#attendees">listed below</a>.

<ul>
<li> <b>Charter/Membership</b> - Bob Bush indicated that he received a
     letter from ONERA indicating that they would like to be formal members
     of the Steering Committee.  Marc Poinot attended the meeting and
     introduced himself and described ONERA's interest in the committee and
     their activities with CGNS.  After some discussion, it was decided to
     introduce a formal motion at the Reno meeting to increase the number of
     Steering Committee members allowed by the Charter to 17, and to elect
     ONERA to serve on the Steering Committee.
<br><br>
<li> <b>ISO Status</b> - Ray Cosner was unavailable for the telecon.  Bob
     Bush gave a quick summary of the status.  There was a thorough review
     of the draft documents at the ISO meeting in Japan in September.  The
     process is continuing more or less on schedule.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Documentation</b> - Charlie Towne gave the status of the CGNS
     documentation pages of the web site.  NASA closed all external access
     to their web pages following the September 11 incidents.  Charlie has
     completed the paperwork required to re-open the site, and expects the
     documents to be available soon.  In the mean time, he has fielded
     several requests for copies of the documentation and sent information to
     individuals via e-mail.
     
     <p>
     The documentation has been revised with clarifications to the
     <tt>Family_t</tt> sections.
     
     <p>
     There has been no movement on the AIAA Standard.  Charlie Towne will
     contact Jim French at the AIAA to see what the next steps should be.
     We are waiting for AIAA to request the documentation in the form they
     require.
     
     <p>
     Charlie Towne received e-mail requesting to copy portions of the CGNS
     documentation to another site as reference material.  As all CGNS
     information is considered in the public domain, and we encourage
     the widest use of the Standard, the Committee has no objections.
     However we strongly recommend that they instead provide links to
     the CGNS documentation so that the revisions are reflected at the
     referencing site, and the CGNS committees and contributors are be
     properly acknowledged.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Reno Meeting</b> - Dave Edwards reported that he has requested
     a room for 30-45 people for Monday evening of the Reno AIAA Aerospace
     Sciences Conference for the Steering Committee meeting, and a Users
     meeting.  These will also be announced at the AIAA web site, and in the
     conference proceedings.  We are tentatively scheduled for 7-8pm for
     the Steering Committee, and 8-9 for the User's meeting.  Times will be
     finalized soon.
     
     <p>
     A technical paper on the status of CGNS implementations in industry
     has been accepted.  Dave Edwards is collecting input from various
     organizations on their status, and will be drafting the paper in
     November.  He will send the paper out for review in December, and it
     will be presented at the Reno meeting.  Anyone interested in having
     their organizations CGNS implementation status summarized in the paper
     is encouraged to submit contributions to Dave.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Software Support</b> - The sub-committee working on Object
     Oriented language access to CGNS files has been quite active.  One of
     the questions that has come up is the relationship between CGNS and
     ADF.  Currently, ADF is the only implementation of the SIDS.  However,
     there are other database standards (e.g. HDF-5) that might provide
     more functionality that ADF (e.g. parallel access).  The SIDS and
     the emerging ISO standard do not specify how the underlying data is
     actually stored, and would seem to permit implementations in addition
     to ADF.  However, this would potentially destroy the data sharing
     capabilities, which is the major driver for CGNS implementations.  If
     multiple implementations of the SIDS is allowed, it was felt that the
     mid-level library and other software supported by the committee should
     be able to detect and read all of the allowed implementations, without
     user intervention.  A definition of what constitutes a `CGNS file' is
     needed that spells out our position on what constitutes a CGNS file,
     and what the committee will support.  Chris Rumsey will draft a policy
     statement on data base implementations of CGNS.  Bob Bush, Manuel
     Kessler and Marc Poinot will review the draft, and the full committee
     will review the final statement.  We hope to adopt a formal position
     that will be published on the Web site at the Reno meeting.
     
     <p>
     There was some discussion of the current C++ implementation being done
     by Manuel Kessler and Udo Tremel, and if it represents a data access
     mechanism, or includes enough functionality that it should also be
     considered a utility that operates on the data.
     
     <p>
     The chemistry extension is being re-worked somewhat to conform to new
     inputs by chemistry experts.  It is hoped that the revision will be
     complete soon, and implementation completed (by Intelligent Light) by
     the end of January.
     
     <p>
     The link and user defined data extensions are being implemented by
     Intelligent Light, and should be available by the end of January.
     
     <p>
     Diane Poirier has implemented a CVS based version control system for
     the libraries.  Intelligent Light is using this system to implement the
     extensions and serving as an alpha test for remote updates to the code.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Issues</b> - Doug McCarthy drafted a policy that would allow,
     encourage or enforce dues from the Steering Committee to be used to
     fund support activities.  There was discussion on the feasibility of
     enforcing the policy, and other potential funding mechanisms.  It
     was felt that proposals for specific extensions to the software were
     generally easier to justify funding.  We will continue to discuss the
     issue as we move forward.
     
     <p>
     The next meeting is scheduled for Reno in January.  Bob Bush (or anyone
     else who would like to suggest) will determine if there is a need for a
     telecon in December to prepare for the meeting.
</ul>

<p>
The meeting was adjourned at about 3:30.
