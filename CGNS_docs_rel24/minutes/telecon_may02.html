<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Telecon Minutes</h2>

15 May 2002<br>
2:00pm Eastern Time<br><br>

Telecon Number: (850) 240-9853, participant code: 557184

<p>
The meeting was called to order at 2:00pm EDT.
The <a href="#attendees">attendees</a> are listed below.
The minutes of the last telecon were approved as posted
on the Web.

<ul>
<li> <b>Charter Business</b> - Bob Bush introduced two people who have
        requested to attend Steering Committee meetings.  These were:
        <br><br>
	Steven J. Massey, Eagle Aeronautics, Hampton, VA<br>
	John Bussoletti, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group
        <br><br>
        Steve Massey introduced himself and indicated that he would be
        working on the NASA Langley contract (discussed in more detail
        below).
<br><br>
<li> <b>ISO Status</b> - Ray Cosner was not available but sent in an
        e-mail indicating that there have been no ISO meetings since the
        last telecon, so there is no update.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Documentation</b> - Bob Bush indicated that Jim French and Craig
        Day have indicated that only 3 Steering Committee members have
        voted thus far on the AIAA standard (re-format of the SIDS).
        Bob encouraged all the Steering Committee Members to vote soon.
        Bob will send a reminder to the Steering Committee members.

        <p>
        Charlie Towne gave an overview of the documentation status.  He
        indicated that there is a new Overview and Entry Level document,
        and that all documents have been version controlled with
        references to software version numbers.

        <p>
        John Chawner indicated that he might not be able to attend
        the Grid Generation Conference in Hawaii, but that in any
        event, CGNS would be represented on the panel discussion by
        a representative from Pointwise.  If John cannot attend, the
        representative will be John Steinbrenner.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Extensions</b> - Chris Rumsey introduced the new Langley
        sub-contracted effort to be performed by Eagle Aeronautics,
        with ICEM CFD contributions.  The effort will focus on three
        areas.  The largest will be the development of utilities to
        support translation, node to cell conversion, primitive to
        conservative variable conversion, etc.  The other 2 areas will
        be adding the ability to delete node children, and adding SIDS
        based extensions.  Bruce Wedan indicated that these capabilities
        will be developed with a TCL/TK GUI and loosely coupled to the
        "adfviewer" viewer that he wrote.  The programming will be done
        in C and so portable.  The capabilities will be developed as a
        series of independent programs callable from scripts or the GUI.

        <p>
        Todd Michal of Boeing indicated that they were interested some
        old extensions that have not been implemented yet.  Some of
        these are in the current Langley sub-contract (Axi Symmetry,
        Rotating Coordinates and Gravity), some need more definition
        (Wall functions and Periodic BC's), and some are yet to be
        proposed (frozen BC's, Bleed-Blowing BC's, Electro-Magnetic
        extensions, and solution specific BC's).  Boeing will take a
        cut at defining the new extension proposals, and reviewing the
        existing extension proposals.

        <p>
        Chris Rumsey reinforced the notion that we need to put more
        fidelity into the extensions before they can be effectively
        implemented.

        <p>
        Diane Poirier proposed taking the beta status off the version
        2.1 release.  The value of <tt>NormalListFlag</tt> returned by
        the function <tt>cg_boco_info</tt> has been modified.  It was
        previously set to 1 when <tt>NormalList</tt> was defined, and 0
        when it was not.  In this new version, if <tt>NormalList</tt>
        exists, <tt>NormalListFlag</tt> is set to the number of data
        contained in <tt>NormalList</tt>.  However, this is seldom used
        to date and should pose no problem.  It was agreed to release
        version 2.1.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Next Meeting</b> - There will be an informal meeting at the
        summer fluids conference in St. Louis the week of 24 June.  The
        tentative time is set for Monday evening, at 7:00.  The room is
        to be determined.  We do not have much on the agenda, Bob Bush
        will send out a request for topics and discussion items.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Other</b> - Todd Michal indicated that the Unstructured
        Grid Consortium was continuing to make progress in defining
        interfaces and an API between grid generation modules.  The
        consortium is using CGNS data structures as a guide for much of
        the development.  There should be a draft out soon for public
        comment.  Todd will send an announcement, with the web address
        to Bob Bush to forward to the CGNS team.
</ul>

<p>
There being no additional issues, the meeting was adjourned.
