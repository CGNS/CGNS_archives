<p>
This chart shows the organization within ISO of the existing Fluid
Dynamics Standard, with the proposed additions.

<p>
At the top are the following four areas.
<ul>
<li> Usage Guide for AP2xx
<li> Part 209, Finite Element Analysis
<li> AP2xx, Fluid Dynamics Data
<li> Part 203, Geometry
</ul>
Of these top-level areas, Parts 209 and 203 already exist, and the
Usage Guide and AP2xx are (or will be) new.

<p>
Below AP2xx is the new area "Part 1xx, CFD Models".
Below that are the following.
<ul>
<li> Part 50, Mathematical Constructs
<li> Part 5a, Mesh-Based Data
<li> Part 5b, Numerical Analysis
<li> Part 5x, Mesh-Based Topology
</ul>
Of these, only Part 50 already exists.

<p>
Finally, at the bottom is "Part 21, Clear-Text Encoding".
This already exists, but needs to be extended to include binary data.

<p>
Each of the new parts must be carried individually through the approval
process.
The lower-level parts will lead the way.
