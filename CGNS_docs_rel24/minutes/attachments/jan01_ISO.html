<h2>What Is STEP?</h2>

<ul>
<li> STEP is an acronym
     <ul>
     <li> <u>ST</u>andard for the <u>E</u>xchange of <u>P</u>roduct model data
     </ul>
<li> Formal name is ISO 10303
     <ul>
     <li> Industrial automation systems and integration
     <li> Product data representation and exchange
     <li> Intended (eventually) to cover the complete life cycle of all
          industrial products
     </ul>
<li> PDES is Product Data Exchange using STEP
     <ul>
     <li> PDES is the U.S. effort, administered through the IGES/PDES
          organization, to support the development and deployment of the
          international STEP standard
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>STEP Approach</h2>

<ul>
<li> The most viable solution:
     <ul>
     <li> public NOT proprietary data model;
     <li> supports extension for additional application;
     <li> has publicly defined interface/access mechanisms;
     <li> usable and stable over the life span of the products and their
          supporting information;
     <li> designed and validated to industry defined needs;
     <li> allows CAD/CAM/CAE industry to construct a compatible suite of
          engineering software.
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Four Levels of Exchange</h2>

<ul>
<li> Level 1 - Physical file transfer 
     <ul>
     <li> communication between two remote processes in which data is
          exchanged via a sequential file of an agreed upon format.
     </ul>
<li> Level 2 - Shared memory access exchange 
     <ul>
     <li> communication between two concurrent processes in which data  
          is exchanged via agreed upon data access processes. There is  
          no assertion of data persistence.                             
     </ul>
<li> Level 3 - Shared database access exchange 
     <ul>
     <li> communication between two or more asynchronous processes in
          which data is exchanged via agreed upon access processes to a
          persistent data repository.
     </ul>
<li> Level 4 - Knowledge-based data exchange 
     <ul>
     <li> communication between two or more asynchronous processes in   
          which data is exchanged via agreed upon access mechanisms     
          to a persistent repository supporting both product data and   
          knowledge of processes related to use of that data. Further   
          definition of this concept and any supporting activity is a   
          future work item.                                             
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Differences between ISO-STEP and CGNS</h2>

<p>
ISO-STEP is based on ...

<ul>
<li> Strong link to Product Data Management 
     <ul>
     <li> Record of all data sources, persistent links if possible
     </ul>
<li> Commonality and re-use of existing data structures to maximum      
     extent possible                                                         
     <ul>
     <li> E.g., re-use data structures from AP203 (geometry), AP209
          (finite element analysis), and AP232 (technical data exchange)
     </ul>
<li> ASCII data exchange 
     <ul>
     <li> We will need to extend ISO-STEP to provide binary data
          exchange as an option                                         
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Major Events</h2>

<p>
Since previous committee meeting, June 2000 

<ul>
<li> Review draft ISO-STEP standard with CGNS Steering Team members
     (July 6-7, Seattle, WA)
     <ul>
     <li> General approval of then-current state; some issues
          identified
     </ul>
<li> Initial draft of standards documentation completed (Sept 2000) 
     <ul>
     <li> Work mainly accomplished by Peter Wilson (Boeing - Seattle) 
     <li> Incomplete, but contains all technical content of SIDS as of  
          August 2000                                                             
     </ul>
<li> ISO meeting (October 16-20, Charleston, SC) 
     <ul>
     <li> Cosner presentation to Change Management Board 
          <ul>
          <li> Focused on scope, component parts, schedule of the Fluid
               Dynamics AP 
          </ul>
     </ul>
<li> Technical Workshop (December 11-14, Seattle, WA) 
     <ul>
     <li> Define the structure of the Fluid Dynamics AP 
     <li> Continue defining the organization and content

<h2>Approval Process</h2>

<ul>
<li> Passage through each "gate" requires a specified number of
     favorable votes
     <ul>
     <li> One country = one vote 
     <li> P-Member countries are voting members (there also are observers) 
     </ul>

<li> Required number of votes becomes more stringent at each "gate"
<li> To gain approval, it is essential to have supporters in most (all)
     of the P-member countries
     <ul>
     <li> There are CGNS users in each P-member country 
     </ul>
<li> P-Member Countries
