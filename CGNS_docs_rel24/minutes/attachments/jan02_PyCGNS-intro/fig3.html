This diagram shows four boxes representing different applications,
including elsA, above a symbol representing a disk file with the text
"Tree on disk: File system/DBMS.
Three of the applications (A, B, and elsA) are within a section
containing a symbol representing an n-memory tree, labeled "Tree
in-memory: Python interpreter", while the fourth (C) is not.

<p>
There are arrows between the different components of the diagram, as
follows:
<ul>
<li> from application A to the in-memory tree
<li> from elsA to the in-memory tree, and back to elsA
<li> from elsA to the on-disk tree
<li> from the in-memory tree to application B
<li> from application B to application C
<li> from the on-disk tree to application C
</ul>
