This diagram illustrates the general layout of the node figures in the
CGNS File Mapping Manual.

At the top is a tan-colored box representing the parent node,
containing the text "Example Node" and "See parent_t figure".

Below the parent node box are three gray boxes representing child
nodes.
The following text describes all three boxes.
<blockquote>
<i>Sub(Child) nodes.
There may be many child nodes.
There may also be additional levels in the hierarchy.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
Inside each of the first two child node boxes are the following ten
entries.
<ol>
<li> Name:
<li> Label:
<li> Data-Type:
<li> Dimensions:
<li> Dimension Values:
<li> Data:
<li> Cardinality:
<li> Parameters:
<li> Functions:

</ol>
The first six of these entries are described as "HDF5 node contents",
and the remaining four entries are described as "Additional information
about the node".

<p>
Inside the third child node box are the following three entries.
<ol>
<li> Name:
