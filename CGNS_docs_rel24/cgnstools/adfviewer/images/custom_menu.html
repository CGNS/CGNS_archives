This is an image of a customized menu bar from the ADFviewer main window.
The menu items along the top, from left to right, are "File", "Config",
"Tree", "Tools", "Utilities", and "Help".

<p>
Under "File" are the standard entries "New", "Open", "Save", "Reload",
"File Info", "Restore", and "Quit".
Between the "Restore" and "Quit" entries are two new entries, "Import"
and "Export", both with additional sub-menus.
The "Import" entry is selected, and its submenu is shown, with entries
"PLOT3D", "Tecplot", "Patran", and "User".

<p>
The new "Utilities" menu is also shown, with entries "Solution
Location", "Solution Variables", "Dimensionalization", "Extract Subset",
and "Interpolation".
