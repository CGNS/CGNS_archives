<p>
There are two plots in this figure, one for the ADF data format and one
for the HDF5 data format, both showing the file size in bytes vs the
number of points per zone.
Each plot has five curves, corresponding to results for 1, 10, 100,
1000, and 10000 zones.

<p>
For both data formats, the file size appears to vary linearly with the
total number of points, at least for the two largest cases.
For a total of 10<sup>9</sup> points (i.e., one zone with 10<sup>9</sup>
points, or 10 zones with 10<sup>8</sup> points each, etc.), the file
size is about 4 gigabytes.
For a total of 10<sup>8</sup> points, the file size is about 0.4
gigabyte.
The plot scale is such that relative differences can't be distinguished
fot the three smaller cases, but for all three the file size is less
than 0.1 gigabyte.
