<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The CFD General Notation System (CGNS) standard has grown significantly
since its first public release in May 1998. The Standard Interface Data
Structures (SIDS) and corresponding Application Programming Interface
(API) have been extended to support unstructured analysis data and
geometry-to-mesh association. Several other extensions are currently
under review: rigid grid motion, deforming grid, timeaccurate and
iterative data, chemistry, multigrid, rotating coordinate systems,
periodic boundary conditions, wall functions, 2D axisymmetry and
Cartesian data. In parallel with the growth of the CGNS standard,
the CGNS governing body has evolved into an independent entity and
established its own charter. Efforts have also been undertaken to
promote CGNS as the ISO standard for the recording of aerodynamic
data. This paper reviews the progress made by CGNS over the past
eighteen months. It first describes the technical advances in the
CGNS database standard, followed by an overview of the new CGNS
organization. Then the status of the CGNS in the ISO standardization
process is presented, as well as a review of implementation and
dissemination of CGNS.

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
The CGNS (CFD General Notation System) project originated during 1994
through a series of meetings that addressed improved transfer of NASA
technology to industry. A principal impediment in this process was
the disparity in I/O formats employed by various flow codes, grid
generators, and other utilities, and CGNS was conceived as a means to
promote "plug-and-play" CFD.  Agreement was reached to develop CGNS
at Boeing, under NASA Contract NAS1-20267, with active participation
by a team of CFD researchers from NASA's Langley, Lewis (now Glenn),
and Ames Research Centers, McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now part of
Boeing), and Boeing Commercial Airplane Group.  This team, which was
joined by ICEM CFD Engineering Corporation of Berkeley, California in
1997, undertook the core of the development. However, in the spirit of
creating a completely open and broadly accepted standard, all interested
parties were encouraged to participate; the US Air Force and Arnold
Engineering Development Center were notably present. From the beginning,
the purpose was to develop a system that could be distributed freely,
including all documentation, software and source code. This goal has now
been fully realized; further, as described below, control of CGNS has
been completely transferred to a public forum known as the CGNS Steering
Committee.

<p>
The specific purpose of CGNS was to provide a standard for recording and
recovering computer data associated with the numerical solution of the
equations of fluid dynamics. The intent was to facilitate the exchange
of CFD data between sites, between applications codes, and across
computing platforms, and to stabilize the archiving of CFD data. The
format implemented by this standard was to be (1) general, (2) portable,
(3) expandable, and (4) durable.

<p>
The resulting system today consists of a collection of conventions,
and software implementing those conventions, for the storage and
retrieval of CFD data.  The system consists of two parts: (1) a standard
format for recording the data, and (2) software that reads, writes,
and modifies data in that format. The format is a conceptual entity
established by the documentation; the software is a physical product
supplied to enable developers to access and produce data recorded in
that format.

<p>
The principal target is the data normally associated with compressible
viscous flow (i.e., the Navier-Stokes equations), but the standard is
also applicable to subclasses such as Euler and potential flows, and
superclasses such as chemically reacting flows. The initial release
addressed multi-block grids, flow fields, boundary conditions, and
block-to-block connection information, as well as a number of auxiliary
items, such as non-dimensionalization, reference states, and equation
set specifications. This stage of development was summarized in
reference 6.  The current paper describes the extensions undertaken
since, including unstructured mesh, moving grids, connections to
geometry definition, and chemistry.

<p>
It is worth noting that extensibility is a fundamental design
characteristic of the system, which in principal could be used for
other disciplines of computational field physics, such as acoustics or
electromagnetics, given the willingness of the cognizant scientific
community to define the conventions.

<p>
The standard format, or paper convention, part of CGNS consists of two
fundamental pieces. The first, known as the Standard Interface Data
Structures (SIDS) (Ref. 2), describes in detail the intellectual content
of the information to be stored. It defines, for example, the precise
meaning of a "boundary condition". The second, known as the File Mapping
(Ref. 4), defines the exact location in a CGNS file where the data is to
be stored.

<p>
The implementation, or software, part of CGNS likewise consists of two
separate entities. CGNS files are read and written by a stand-alone
database manager called ADF (Advanced Data Format) (Ref. 3).  ADF
manages a tree-like data structure, implemented as a binary file. Since
the format of this file is completely controlled by ADF, and since ADF
is written in ANSI C (FORTRAN wrappers are provided), these files and
ADF itself are portable to any environment which supports ANSI C. ADF is
available separately and constitutes a useful tool for the storage of
large quantities of scientific data.

<p>
ADF, however, implements no knowledge of CFD or of the File Mapping. To
simplify access to CGNS files, a second layer of software known
as the Mid-Level Library (Ref. 5) is provided. This layer is in
effect an API, or Application Programming Interface for CFD. The API
incorporates knowledge of the CFD data structures, their meaning and
their location in the file, enabling applications such as flow codes
and grid generators to access the data in familiar terms. The API is
therefore the piece of the CGNS system most visible to applications
developers. Like ADF, the API is written in ANSI C; all public API
routines have FORTRAN counterparts.

<p>
The overall architecture of CGNS is that of shared files accessible by
the various software tools common to CFD: solvers, grid generators,
field visualizers, and postprocessors. These applications must
be modified, using the API, to be able to access CGNS data. Each
application then serves as an editor of the data, adding to, modifying
or interpreting it according to that application's specific role.
The user, or a locally developed user interface, remains responsible for
executing the required actions and for the disposition of the files.

<p>
The CGNS elements are documented individually. Visitors to the main
web site, www.CGNS.org, will find all documentation, as well as the
software, both compiled and source code. For those new to CGNS, the
Overview (Ref. 1) and the CGNS System paper (Ref. 6) are recommended.

<h2>2. Advances in the CGNS System</h2>

<p>
The first release of the CGNS standard supported structured topology,
where multi-block connectivity could be either one-to-one abutting,
mismatched abutting or overset. It defined standards for the
storage of grid coordinates, flow solutions, boundary conditions,
convergence history, and reference state. Dimensional units and
non-dimensionalization information could be associated with each type of
data. Additionally, it provided conventions for archiving the governing
equations including the gas, viscosity, thermal conductivity, turbulence
and diffusion models. It also provided for the recording of descriptive
data throughout the file.

<p>
Following this first release, the project to add support for
unstructured topology and geometry-to-mesh association was immediately
undertaken. Proposals were collected and the CGNS team organized
meetings with CFD researchers familiar with unstructured topology
and/or geometry data.  New data structures were defined and added to
the standard to hold the additional information, and the CGNS library
was augmented to support the new data structures.  Paragraphs
<a href="#para2.1">2.1</a> and <a href="#para2.2">2.2</a> describe the
implementation of the unstructured topology and geometry-to-mesh
association in the CGNS standard.

<p>
Several other extensions are currently under work at various stages of
maturity. The proposals for adding support for rigid grid motion, point
by point grid motion (deforming grid), and iterative or time-accurate
data are pending final approval and will be the next addition to the
CGNS API. These new data structures are described in paragraphs
<a href="#para2.3">2.3</a>, <a href="#para2.4">2.4</a>, and
<a href="#para2.5">2.5</a>. Other proposals still at the discussion
level include the addition of chemistry, multigrid, rotating
coordinates, periodic boundary conditions, wall functions, 2D
axisymmetry and Cartesian data.

<h3>2.1 Unstructured Analysis Data</h3>

<p>
This section describes how the addition of unstructured data was
incorporated to the CGNS system, and how it affected the Standard
Interface Data Structures (SIDS).

<p>
There are basically two major differences between the way structured
and unstructured mesh data are recorded.  In a structured mesh, a
node is identified with its computational coordinates. A node has
as many computational coordinates as there are dimensions in the
mesh. For example, in a 3D grid, any node position in the mesh is
uniquely defined giving three computational coordinates. The physical
coordinate vectors and all the field vectors (solution, discrete
boundary conditions, etc.) use the computational coordinates of each
node as array indices. However, the mapping of the physical coordinates
to the computational coordinates is only possible in a structured
grid. In an unstructured grid, the nodes are simply given a number from
1 to N, where N is the number of nodes.

<p>
The second major difference in the way structured and unstructured
grids are recorded is the element definition.  In a structured grid,
the elements can always be recomputed easily using the computational
coordinates, and therefore they are usually not written in the data
file.  For an unstructured grid, the element connectivity can not be
easily built, so this additional information is generally added to the
data file. The element information typically includes the element type
or shape, and the list of nodes for each element.

<p>
In order to conciliate the differences between structured and
unstructured mesh files, two new parameters were introduced. The SIDS
already defined the expression <tt>IndexDimension</tt> as the number
of computational coordinates required to uniquely define a node in a
mesh.  For structured grids, this number equals the dimension of the
mesh cells. For unstructured grid, only one index is necessary to
locate a node in the mesh, regardless of the dimension of the mesh
cells. The parameter <tt>IndexDimension</tt> is no longer sufficient to
indicate the dimensionality of the cells. Therefore a second dimensional
parameter called <tt>CellDimension</tt> was defined. For structured
meshes, <tt>CellDimension</tt> and <tt>IndexDimension</tt> are always
equal, but for unstructured grids, they differ when the cells have two
or more dimensions.

<p>
To define a vector in a mesh, such as the normal vector to a mesh
face, one needs to know the number of dimensions in the physical
space. For example, the surface mesh around an aircraft is composed
of bi-dimensional cells (faces or shell elements), but expressing
the normal vectors to these cells requires three-dimensional
physical coordinates. This leads to the definition of a third
dimensional parameter, the <tt>PhysicalDimension</tt>. In addition
to the topolgy type (structured or unstructured), these three
parameters, <tt>IndexDimension</tt>, <tt>CellDimension</tt> and
<tt>PhysicalDimension</tt>, are necessary to uniquely define a
particular mesh type. For example, an unstructured surface mesh on an
aircraft implies that:
<pre>
   IndexDimension=1
   CellDimension=2
   PhysicalDimension=3
</pre>

<p>
Table 1 summarizes all possible combinations of these parameters for
structured and unstructured grids.

</center>

<p>
The definition of the new dimensional parameters <tt>CellDimension</tt>
and <tt>PhysicalDimension</tt> allowed using most of the existing SIDS
with minimal changes when adding support for unstructured grids. By
selecting the appropriate dimensional parameter to set the size of data
arrays, the same data structures can be used for both structured and
unstructured cases. For example, the number of nodes can be recorded in
the array:
<pre>
   Nnodes[IndexDimension]
</pre>

<p>
For a 3D-structured grid, this automatically leads to a 3D array
containing the number of nodes in each of the three computational
directions. On the other hand, it results in a mono-dimensional
array for a 3D-unstructured grid. The solution vector and grid
coordinates are also recorded in arrays of <tt>IndexDimension</tt>
dimensions. Therefore, their definition is independent of the
mesh type as well. The new parameters <tt>CellDimension</tt> and
<tt>PhysicalDimension</tt> also fulfill the purpose of generalizing
the data structures for both topology types.  The connectivity between
zones is defined using interpolation coefficients to locate each
point of a zone in the neighboring zone. The number of coefficients
required is equal to <tt>CellDimension</tt>, independently of the mesh
type. Similarly, position vectors or normal vectors are defined using
the dimensional parameter <tt>PhysicalDimension</tt> in both types of
meshes.

<p>
As a result, the unstructured zones were introduced into the CGNS system
without the need to define a new data structure specific to unstructured
mesh. Not only does this simplify the SIDS, but it also facilitates
the API and its implementation. As before, a <tt>CGNSBase_t</tt>
data structure may contain one to several zones. The only difference
now is that some of these zones may be structured, while others are
unstructured.

<p>
To accommodate the definition of unstructured zones, two new children
were added to the <tt>Zone_t</tt> data structure, as shown in Figure 1.

     longdesc="aiaa00-0681/fig1.html">
<br><br>
<b>Fig. 1 Zone Data Structure</b>
</center>

<p>
The node <tt>ZoneType_t</tt> records if the zone is structured
or unstructured. It simply holds the data-name identifier
<tt>Structured</tt> or <tt>Unstructured</tt>. The other new child is the
data structure <tt>Elements_t</tt> that holds the element information
for unstructured grids. A zone may contain several <tt>Elements_t</tt>
data structures. Each <tt>Elements_t</tt> data structure holds several
child nodes, as illustrated in Figure 2.

     alt="Elements Data Structure"
     longdesc="aiaa00-0681/fig2.html">
<br><br>
<b>Fig. 2 Elements Data Structure</b>
</center>

<p>
The <tt>ElementRange</tt> node contains the index of the first and
last elements defined in the <tt>ElementConnectivity_t</tt> array. The
elements are indexed with a global numbering system for all element
sections in the same <tt>Zone_t</tt> data structure.  They are also
listed as a continuous list of element numbers within a single element
section. These element indices may be used elsewhere in the database
to define a boundary condition patch, or to specify zone to zone
connectivity. <tt>ElementType_t</tt> is an enumeration of the supported
element types.
<pre>
   ElementType_t := enumeration(
      Null, NODE, BAR_2, BAR_3,
      TRI_3, TRI_6, QUAD_4, QUAD_8, QUAD_9,
      TETRA_4, TETRA_10, PYRA_5, PYRA_14,
      PENTA_6, PENTA_15, PENTA_18,
      HEXA_8, HEXA_20, HEXA_27, NGON_<i>n</i>);
</pre>
where <tt>NGON_<i>n</i></tt> is used to express a polygon of n nodes.

<p>
<tt>ElementSizeBoundary</tt> indicates if the elements are
sorted, and how many boundary elements are recorded. By default,
<tt>ElementSizeBoundary</tt> is set to zero, indicating that
the elements are not sorted. If the elements are sorted,
<tt>ElementSizeBoundary</tt> is set to the number of elements at
the boundary, and the boundary elements are listed first in the
<tt>ElementConnectivity</tt> array.

<p>
For face elements in 3D, or bar elements in 2D, information regarding
the parent cells may be recorded. <tt>ParentData</tt> holds the parent
cell numbers of a face element, and the face position within these
parent elements. At the boundaries, the second parent is set to zero.

<h3>2.2 Geometry-to-Mesh Association</h3>

<p>
Another important segment of the CFD data is the description of the
geometry data. The definition of the underlying geometry is mandatory to
perform operations such as mesh refinement or coarsening. It may also be
necessary in various post-processors for the analysis and display of the
results. This section describes how the geometry-to-mesh association was
incorporated in the CGNS system.

<p>
The goal in the CGNS geometry specification is to connect the geometry
definition of the various components of a model to the computational
grid. It enables the recovery of the geometry corresponding to a given
mesh surface, or vice versa.

<p>
The CGNS team decided not to create a new geometry file format, but
rather to link to the existing ones. This approach offers several
advantages with respect to incorporating the CGNS system into existent
software applications.  Most CFD users have already adopted a CAD
system file format, which is most likely intricately connected to their
software. Agreeing to change to a new CAD file format could imply major
rewriting of several CFD software tools. At the very least, translators
would be needed to interface back and forth between each CAD file format
and a new CGNS standard. This would make the implementation of the new
standard more laborious.

<p>
In addition, most existing CAD file formats have proven to be effective
and sufficient to accurately define the geometry data and to facilitate
data exchange between sites and applications. To create a new format
would duplicate existing work. For these reasons, it was decided
that the CAD geometric entities described in the CAD database would
not be redefined within the CGNS file. Instead the CGNS system would
incorporate the geometry-to-grid connectivity by referring directly to
the geometric entities defined in these CAD files.

<p>
Since there is rarely a 1-to-1 connection between mesh regions and
geometric entities, the geometry-to-mesh associations are set through
one layer of indirection.  Rather than mapping the geometry data
directly to the mesh entities, the association is made indirectly using
a layer of objects called CFD families. A CFD family may be composed of
one or several mesh regions (blocks or boundary condition patches). In
the corresponding CAD file, the same family is represented by a group
of geometric entities such as b-spline curves and surfaces, on which
the mesh faces are projected. Each family is contained solely within a
single CAD database.

<p>
The association between a node and a CFD family is easily made
invariable under most CAD modeling operations. The association
between a node and a specific CAD entity can not. Therefore one of
the main advantages of this layer of indirection concept is that the
mesh density and geometric entities may be modified without altering
the association between nodes and families, or between families and
geometric entities.  This is very beneficial when handling boundary
conditions and properties. Instead of setting boundary conditions
directly on mesh entities, they can be associated with the families
(<tt>FamilyBC_t</tt>). Since the families are stable in the sense
that they are not subject to operations such as geometric changes,
modification of mesh topology, mesh refinement or coarsening, the
boundary conditions do not need to be redefined each time the model is
modified.

<p>
For the purpose of defining properties, families are also supported on
groups of interior mesh elements. For example, a 3D mesh may comprise
several CFD families of 3D elements, and several CFD families of
boundary elements. The families of 3D elements are typically used to
specify volume properties, e.g. material properties such as porosity,
while those containing 2D elements serve primarily to define boundary
conditions.

<p>
The implementation of the geometry-to-mesh association implied a few
additions to the SIDS. The most important one was to create a new data
structure to hold the CFD family data. The new data structure is called
<tt>Family_t</tt> and is added to the <tt>CGNSBase_t</tt> structure for
each CFD family of the model. Figure 3 shows the layout of this data
structure within the CGNS hierarchical database.

<a name="f:fig3"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img src="aiaa00-0681/fig3.png"
     alt="Family Data Structure"
     longdesc="aiaa00-0681/fig3.html">
<br><br>
<b>Fig. 3 Family Data Structure</b>
</center>

<p>
The <tt>Family_t</tt> data structure contains the name of the file
where the geometry is stored (<tt>GeometryFile_t</tt>), as well as
the geometry format (<tt>GeometryFormat_t</tt>) in which the file is
written (IGES, SDRC, Unigraphics, Pro-Engineer, etc.). In addition,
one may specify for each CFD family, the name of the geometry entities
(<tt>GeometryEntity_t</tt>) to be associated with the family. There may
be one to several geometry entities for a given family. If no geometry
entity is specified, it is assumed by default that the family name and
the geometry entity name are the same.

<p>
Node and family association is implemented by assigning a
<tt>FamilyName</tt> to a group of nodes of the computational grid. The
family name consists of an alphanumeric string.  A <tt>FamilyName</tt>
is an optional attribute to each zone and boundary condition patch. It
is stored within the CGNS file under the zone (<tt>Zone_t</tt>) or the
boundary condition (<tt>BC_t</tt>) data structures.

<p>
The following three sections describes proposals for the addition of
rigid grid motion, arbitrary grid motion and iterative or time-accurate
data. These proposals are mature and should be soon incorporated to the
API.

<h3>2.3 Grid Motion</h3>

<p>
The addition of rigid body motion data to the CGNS file
enables the use of moving grids such as might be required for
turbo-machinery applications. The mesh location is determined
without the need to alter the original mesh definition recorded
under <tt>GridCoordinates_t</tt>. A new data structure named
<tt>RigidGridMotion_t</tt> is created to record the necessary data
defining a rigid translation and/or rotation of the grid coordinates.

<p>
It is proposed that the rigid grid motion be recorded
independently for each zone of the CGNS base.  Therefore the
<tt>RigidGridMotion_t</tt> data structure would be added under each
zone data structure (<tt>Zone_t</tt>). There may be zero to several
<tt>RigidGridMotion_t</tt> nodes under a <tt>Zone_t</tt> node.  The
multiple rigid grid motion definitions may be associated with different
iterations or time steps in the computation. This association is
recorded under the <tt>IterativeOrTemporalData_t</tt> data structure
(paragraph <a href="#para2.5">2.5</a>).

<p>
The <tt>RigidGridMotion_t</tt> data structure is illustrated in Figure 4.

<a name="f:fig4"></a>
<br><br>
<center>

     alt="Rigid Grid Motion Data Structure"
     longdesc="aiaa00-0681/fig4.html">
<br><br>
<b>Fig. 4 Rigid Grid Motion Data Structure</b>
</center>

<p>
<tt>RigidGridMotionType_t</tt> is an enumeration type that describes the
type of rigid grid motion. It may be set to either <tt>ConstantRate</tt>
or <tt>VariableRate</tt>. <tt>ConstantRate</tt> is used when the
<tt>RigidVelocity</tt> and <tt>RigidRotationRate</tt> are both constant
and at least one is nonzero.  OriginLocation holds the physical
coordinates of the origin before and after the rigid grid motion. The
<tt>RigidRotationAngle</tt> node records the rotation angles about each
axis of the translated coordinate system. <tt>RigidVelocity</tt> is the
velocity vector of the origin translation and <tt>RigidRotationRate</tt>
is the rotation rate vector about the axis of the translated coordinate
system.

<p>
Additional optional elements are <tt>DataClass_t</tt>,
<tt>DimensionalUnits_t</tt> and <tt>Descriptor_t</tt>. Any number
of <tt>DataArray_t</tt> nodes may also be recorded under the
<tt>RigidGridMotion_t</tt> data structure to support data not covered by
this specification.

<h3>2.4 Arbitrary Grid Motion</h3>

<p>
The <tt>ArbitraryGridMotion_t</tt> data structure allows the CGNS file
to contain information about arbitrary grid deformations such as might
be required for unsteady aeroelastic applications. If not present, the
grid is assumed to be rigid.

<p>
It is proposed that the arbitrary grid motion be recorded
independently for each zone of the CGNS base. Therefore the
<tt>ArbitraryGridMotion_t</tt> data structure would be added under each
zone data structure (<tt>Zone_t</tt>). There may be zero to several
<tt>ArbitraryGridMotion_t</tt> nodes under a <tt>Zone_t</tt> node. The
multiple arbitrary grid motion definition may be associated with
different iterations or time steps in the computation. This association
is recorded under the <tt>IterativeOrTemporalData_t</tt> data structure
(paragraph <a href="#para2.5">2.5</a>).

<p>
The <tt>ArbitraryGridMotion_t</tt> data structure is illustrated in
Figure 5.

The <tt>DataArray_t</tt> nodes are used to store the components of
the grid velocity vector. Table 2 lists the new data-name identifiers
proposed to record these vectors in the Cartesian, cylindrical,
spherical, and auxiliary coordinate systems.

<p>
<tt>ArbitraryGridMotionType_t</tt> is an enumeration type that
describes the type of arbitrary grid motion. The type is either
<tt>NonDeformingGrid</tt> or <tt>DeformingGrid</tt>. The only required
element of the <tt>ArbitraryGridMotion_t</tt> data structure is
the <tt>ArbitraryGridMotionType</tt>. Thus, even if a deforming
grid application does not require the storage of grid velocity
data, the <tt>ArbitraryGridMotion_t</tt> node must exist, with
<tt>ArbitraryGridMotionType</tt> set to <tt>DeformingGrid</tt>, to
indicate that the mesh coordinates after deformation are recorded under
the given zone.

<p>
The <tt>DataClass_t</tt>, <tt>DimensionalUnits_t</tt> and
<tt>Descriptor_t</tt> nodes may optionally be specified under the
<tt>RigidGridMotion_t</tt> nodes. <tt>Rind</tt> is an optional field
that indicates the number of rind planes included in the grid velocity
data. It only applies to structured zones. The <tt>GridLocation</tt>
specifies the location of the velocity data with respect to the grid;
if absent, the data is assumed to coincide with grid vertices (i.e.
<tt>GridLocation = Vertex</tt>).

<p>
In addition to the creation of the <tt>ArbitraryGridMotion_t</tt>
data structure to record the velocity of each grid point, it is
proposed to allow multiple <tt>GridCoordinates_t</tt> nodes under
a <tt>Zone_t</tt>. This enables the storage of the instantaneous
grid locations at different time steps or iterations. The original
grid coordinates definition, as currently defined in the SIDS,
remains unchanged with the name <tt>GridCoordinates</tt>. Point
by point grid velocity implies a deformation (or potentially only
motion) of the grid points relative to each other. Because the
original grid coordinates definition is to remain unchanged, any
deformed coordinates are to be written with a different name (e.g.,
<tt>GridCoordinates1</tt> or another user-defined name) and are to
be pointed to using the <tt>GridCoordinatesPointers</tt> in the data
structure <tt>IterativeOrTemporalData_t</tt> (paragraph
<a href="#para2.5">2.5</a>).

<h3>2.5 Iterative and Time-Accurate Data</h3>

<p>
In order to keep a record of time dependent or iterative
solutions and mesh data, a new data structure called
<tt>IterativeOrTemporalData_t</tt> is defined. This new data structure
contains information relative to each time step or iteration stored.

<p>
It is proposed that the interative and time-accurate _data structure
be recorded independently for each zone of the CGNS base. Therefore it
would be added under each zone data structure (<tt>Zone_t</tt>). There
may be zero to several <tt>IterativeOrTemporalData_t</tt> nodes under a
<tt>Zone_t</tt> node.

<p>
Several different simulation types may be recorded under CGNS, but
all zones under the same CGNS base must have the same simulation
type. It is proposed to add a new <tt>Descriptor_t</tt> node under
the <tt>CGNSBase_t</tt> data structure to specify which simulation
type is recorded in the base. The <tt>Descriptor_t</tt> node named
<tt>SimulationType</tt> holds a simulation type identifier such as
<tt>NonTimeAccurate</tt> or <tt>TimeAccurate</tt>.

<p>
The <tt>IterativeOrTemporalData_t</tt> data structure is illustrated in
Figure 6.

     longdesc="aiaa00-0681/fig6.html">
<br><br>
<b>Fig. 6 Iterative or Temporal Data Structure</b>
</center>

<p>
The number of time steps or the number of iterations is a
required element of this data structure, and is recorded in
the field <tt>NumberOfSteps</tt>. <tt>TimeValues</tt> or
<tt>IterationValues</tt> must also be defined. If both are used, there
must be a one-to-one correspondence between them. The data arrays
<tt>RigidGridMotionPointers</tt>, <tt>GridCoordinatesPointers</tt>,
<tt>FlowSolutionsPointers</tt> and <tt>ArbitraryGridMotionPointers</tt>
are optional. Their purpose is to associate with each time step or
iteration the appropriate data structures for rigid grid motion,
arbitrary grid motion, grid coordinates and flow solutions. They
refer by name to data structures within the current zone. The name
"<tt>Null</tt>" is used when a particular time or iteration does not
have a corresponding data structure to point to.

<p>
The <tt>DataClass_t</tt>, <tt>DimensionalUnits_t</tt> and
<tt>Descriptor_t</tt> nodes may optionally be specified under the
<tt>IterativeOrTemporalData_t</tt> nodes. In addition, any number of
<tt>DataArray_t</tt> node is allowed.  These should be used to record
data not covered by this specification.

<p>
The data structures defining rigid grid motion, arbitrary grid motion
and iterative or time-accurate data are the first proposals to follow
the extension review process recently established by the CGNS Steering
Committee.  The following section describes the new organization
governing CGNS, and how CGNS users may submit proposals for extensions
to the existing standard.

<h2>3. CGNS Steering Committee</h2>

<p>
The CGNS Steering Committee has been formed to ensure the continuation
of the CFD General Notation System. The Committee has adopted a
Charter that was approved by the Committee on 21 October 1999. The
Charter lays out the mission, organization and governing principles
of the Steering Committee. The Charter can be found at the CGNS web
site, at www.CGNS.org.  In summary, the Charter defines several
responsibilities of the CGNS Steering Committee that support its
fundamental mission. They include:

<ul>
<li> maintaining the software implementing the Standard, documentation
     of the Standard and an open web site to disseminate information on
     the Standard,
<li> providing mechanisms for the evolution of the Standard,
<li> promoting the acceptance of the Standard,
<li> providing user services, and
<li> determining the means to fund activities in support of the Standard.
</ul>

<p>
The CGNS Steering Committee is organized as a voluntary organization
that governs by consensus. The Committee meets at a minimum of once per
year, and is represented by a Chairperson. The Chairperson coordinates
activities, facilitate meetings and serves as a focal point for the
Committee. The Charter explicitly states that all parties are welcome
to bring forward issues and participate in the development of the
Standard, whether or not they are members of the Steering Committee. The
CGNS Steering Committee is made up of representatives from specific
institutions, rather than individuals. Membership on the Committee
is currently limited to 15 institutions that participate in the
development, maintenance, distribution and use of the Standard. The
initial members of the Steering Committee are:

<ul>
<li> NASA Ames
<li> NASA Langley
<li> NASA Glenn
<li> Boeing Commercial
<li> Boeing Phantom Works
<li> Boeing Space & Communications
<li> United Technologies Research Center
<li> ICEM CFD Engineering
<li> Fluent, Inc.
<li> Rolls-Royce Allison
<li> US Air Force
<li> ADAPCO
</ul>

<p>
The CGNS Charter also defines Standing Committees to which the Steering
Committee may delegate responsibilities.  These committees make
recommendations to the Steering Committee, which retains the authority
to make final decisions. The current Standing Committees are:

<ul>
<li> Outreach/Membership Team
<li> Documentation Committee
<li> Software Focal Point
</ul>

<p>
The Software Focal Point is the prime source for maintaining and
distributing the existing documentation and software, and developing and
distributing new software resulting from extensions to the standard.

<p>
The CGNS Charter also lays out the governing principles that are to be
followed. In general, the Charter calls on the Committee to adhere to
the philosophy used for "free software", as defined under the
GNU Lesser Public License.  In particular, the freedom to:

<ul>
<li> Run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0)
<li> Study how the program works, and adapt it to ones needs (freedom 1)
<li> Redistribute copies so one can help their neighbor (freedom 2)
<li> Improve the program, and release improvements to the public, so that
     the whole community benefits (freedom 3)
</ul>

<p>
These freedoms promote the promulgation of the CGNS Standard by allowing
users the freedom to redistribute copies, with or without modifications,
either gratis or charging a fee for distribution, to anyone anywhere.

<p>
The Charter also calls for changes and additions to the Standard. CGNS
has been developed with the key concepts of flexibility and
extensibility in mind. In order to address a perceived need or
deficiency in the Standard, a proposal must be submitted to the
Steering Committee. The proposal is then presented in an open and
public forum, and includes a draft of changes to the SIDS and File
Mappings. Finally, the Steering Committee is responsible for accepting,
altering or rejecting the proposal, and determines the timetable for
implementation. The primary requirement for any proposal is to maintain
code compatibility with the existing Standard.

<h2>4. Migration to an ISO standard</h2>

<p>
The Boeing Company has been a participant from the start in the
development of the CGNS standard for CFD data.  For many years, Boeing
also has taken an active role in the development of ISO standards for
the exchange of engineering data. In February 1998, Boeing initiated an
activity to establish an evolved form of the CGNS data standard as an
ISO standard for archiving and exchanging aerodynamic data. Boeing's
plan to lead the development of this standard was presented to ISO
Technical Committee 184 (Industrial Automation Systems and Integration),
Subcommittee 4 (Industrial Data), Working Group 3 (Product Modeling)
during their meeting in January 1999.

<p>
In November 1999, Boeing presented to this Working Group a formal
proposal for development of an aerodynamics data exchange standard. This
proposal has been accepted by the ISO organization. The effort to
develop an Aerodynamics Application Protocol (AP) is now formally
sanctioned as an ongoing ISO project. The end product will be an
ISO/STEP AP2xx (200-series number not yet assigned).

<p>
The cognizant ISO subcommittee (SC4 - Industrial Data) consists of
seventeen voting member countries.  Decisions throughout this process
are made on the basis of one country, one vote. The seven stages in
developing an ISO Application Protocol (AP) standard (Ref. 7) are:

<ol>
<li> <u>Preliminary Stage</u> - Planning for possible standardization
     projects (accomplished 1998-99).
<li> <u>Proposal Stage</u> - Culminates in approval to start a new AP
     project (completed November 1999).
<li> <u>Preparatory Stage</u> - Develop a Working Draft and a New Work
     Item (planned completion October 2000).
<li> <u>Committee Stage</u> - Consensus is achieved on a Committee Draft
     (planned to start October 2000).
<li> <u>Enquiry Stage</u> - Vote on Draft International Standard.
<li> <u>National Stage</u> - Vote on Final Draft International Standard.
<li> <u>Publication Stage</u> - ISO publishes the International Standard.
</ol>

<p>
The ISO approval process specifies a schedule for advancing through
these stages. Most ISO standards projects begin with an idea and a
clean sheet of paper.  CGNS, however, is at a far more advanced state.
Therefore, it is believed that this initiative can advance through the
approval stages at an accelerated pace. The ISO approval "clock" begins
running when the New Work Item is approved. Current plans anticipate
this approval in October 2000. Table 3 display the ISO required schedule
and planned completion dates, based on this assumed approval date.

<p>
The current plan is to focus first on completion of the CFD data
standard based on CGNS. However, the ultimate scope also will encompass
other forms of aerodynamic and fluid dynamic digital data, including
wind tunnel data and flight test data. Once the CFD portion of the AP
standard is in place, we anticipate extending the AP by amendments to
include these additional types of data.  The schedule presented above
applies to the initial standards process, not to the process of planned
amendments.

<p>
Based on initial feedback from ISO subcommittee members, the scope
also should extend beyond aerospace aerodynamics to include ground
vehicle fluid dynamics and ship hydrodynamics. In a planning meeting
held in December 1999, a decision was taken to accept this requested
increase in scope. Accordingly, the project has been re-titled from
"Aerodynamics AP" to "Fluid Dynamics AP". However, the planning sequence
is unchanged: to establish a CFD data exchange standard first (in accord
with the schedule presented above), and to extend the data exchange
standard subsequently to accommodate other types of digital data in
fluid dynamics.

<p>
In the process of reaching agreement on an ISO standard, it is
anticipated that significant modifications may be proposed based
on the current CGNS standard. People or organizations wishing to
participate in this process are invited to contact the CGNS Steering
Committee, or the third author of this paper (Cosner) via e-mail at
raymond.r.cosner@boeing.com.

<h2>5. Dissemination & Implementation</h2>

<p>
CGNS has been welcome by the CFD community worldwide. The effort
of standardizing the data exchange format for aerodynamic data is
considered by most a necessity long overdue. Since its first release in
May 1998, the CFD General Notation System has received an overwhelming
support from Academia, Industry, and Research Agencies. At the time of
writing, 240 users from over 25 countries have registered at the CGNS
web site. In addition to implementing the CGNS standard into their own
applications, several users participate actively in new extensions to
the CGNS system.

<p>
The CGNS Steering Committee is aware of several CFD applications, from
both research and commercial organizations in U.S.A. and Europe, having
implemented or interfaced with the CGNS standard successfully:

<ul>
<li> PEGASUS/OVERFLOW - NASA Ames Research Center
<li> CFL3D - NASA Langley Research Center
<li> Visual3 - M.I.T. and ICEM CFD Engineering
<li> Plot3D - NASA Ames Research Center
<li> NPARC - NPARC Alliance
<li> TLNS3D - Boeing Seattle and NASA Langley Research Center
<li> ICEM CFD HEXA - ICEM CFD Engineering
<li> WIND - NPARC Alliance
<li> GASP V4 - Aerosoft, Inc.
<li> CFF - Boeing St-Louis
<li> UPS - NASA Langley Research Center
<li> HYDRA CFD - Oxford University and Rolls-Royce
<li> ADPAC - Rolls-Royce Allison
<li> Cart3D - NASA Ames Research Center
<li> APPT - Boeing Rocketdyne
<li> EURANUS - NUMECA International
<li> FIELDVIEW - Intelligent Light
<li> Tecplot - AMTEC Engineering, Inc.
</ul>

<p>
Figure 7 illustrates an example of a typical CGNS file. It is given
to provide the reader with an idea of the type of information that
goes into a CGNS file and how it is organized. This particular example
is from the structured-grid CFL3D code. It is for a one-zone grid
(to keep the example relatively short), and does not include grid
connectivity information, which would be necessary for multiple zone
grids or a single zone grid that connected with itself. Each ADF node is
represented with its name and label (name/label). However, when the only
difference between the name and label is "<tt>_t</tt>", the name has
been omitted.

<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt><b>Fig. 7 Example of Implementation</b>

<p>
The CGNS system was designed to provide a complete description of
CFD data, so that others could unambiguously read and use it. This
example is a 3-D case in which volume data is recorded. The parameters
<tt>CellDimension</tt> and <tt>PhysicalDimension</tt> are stored in the
<tt>CGNSBase_t</tt> node, while <tt>IndexDimension</tt> is recorded
for each zone. The <tt>Zone_t</tt> node contains information about the
zone's grid size, for example, (2 &times; 65 &times; 97) vertices and
(1 &times; 64 &times; 96) cells. <tt>ZoneType_t</tt> in this example
specifies <tt>Structured</tt>, and the grid coordinates are written
under <tt>GridCoordinates_t</tt>.

<p>
The boundary conditions are specified under <tt>ZoneBC_t</tt>. For
example, the data for the boundary patch "<tt>Ilo_Seg1</tt>" might be
<tt>BCSymmetryPlane</tt>. <tt>IndexRange_t</tt> gives the index range
over which this boundary condition applies. Note that in this example,
the user has also added the descriptor node under <tt>ZoneBC_t</tt>
called <tt>CFL3DType</tt>. This node is not part of the CGNS standard,
but rather was added for convenience in order to tie in the CGNS
boundary condition identifier with a type specific to the CFL3D
code. Descriptors like this may be sprinkled throughout the CGNS
file. They provide an easy way to add descriptive comments to a file for
the benefit of present or future readability. Their existence in no way
limits the ability of others to read and use the file.

<p>
Flow solution information is stored in data arrays under the
<tt>FlowSolution_t</tt> data structure. CFL3D gives this information
at cell centers; thus, <tt>GridLocation_t</tt> specifies
<tt>CellCenter</tt> in the example. The node <tt>Rind_t</tt> indicates
the number of rind cells (ghost cells) at which flow solution
information is also given. For example, if there is one rind cell
specified at <tt>jlo</tt> and one at <tt>jhi</tt>, then the expected
dimensions of the data arrays in this example would be (i &times; j
&times; k) = (1 &times; 64 + 2 &times; 96).

<p>
The <tt>FlowEquationSet_t</tt> node contains information about
how the solution was run. In the example presented here,
<tt>EquationDimension</tt> is 3, <tt>GoverningEquations</tt>
is <tt>NSTurbulent</tt>, <tt>GasModel</tt> is <tt>Ideal</tt>,
<tt>ViscosityModel</tt> is <tt>SutherlandLaw</tt>,
<tt>ThermalConductivityModel</tt> is <tt>ConstantPrandtl</tt>,
<tt>TurbulenceClosure</tt> is <tt>EddyViscosity</tt>, and
<tt>TurbulenceModel</tt> is <tt>OneEquation_SpalartAllmaras</tt>. The
node <tt>DiffusionModel</tt> indicates whether thin-layer or full
Navier-Stokes was used, and in which index directions.

<p>
The convergence history may be stored for each individual zone or
globally under the <tt>CGNSBase_t</tt> node, as shown in this example.
<tt>DataClass_t</tt> specifies the type of data given. The class of data
used by the CFL3D code is <tt>NormalizedByUnknownDimensional</tt>. Then,
further information regarding the reference quantities is given
under <tt>ReferenceState_t</tt>. The nodes <tt>VelocitySound</tt>,
<tt>ViscosityKinematic</tt>, <tt>Density</tt> and <tt>Length</tt>
give the reference levels by which all quantities in the file have
been nondimensionalized. Other nodes such as <tt>Prandtl</tt>,
<tt>Temperature</tt>, and <tt>SpecificHeatRatio</tt> also appear in the
file but have been left off in the example for the sake of brevity.

<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
This paper described the advances in the CGNS database standard for
aerodynamics and CFD. Since 1994, CGNS has grown into a data standard
sufficient to support the majority of CFD applications while providing
for easy data exchange between sites, computing environments and
applications. Since the initial public release of the CGNS documentation
and software in May 1998, additions to the standard included the
incorporation of unstructured topology and mesh-to-geometry association.

<p>
In parallel to the growth of the standard, the CGNS organization
has been transformed into an open and public committee whose main
purposes is to ensure the continuation of CGNS. The CGNS Steering
committee has adopted in 1999 a Charter defining its governing rules
and mission. In addition to the maintenance of the current standard,
the CGNS Steering Committee has the responsibility to allow for the
growth of the standard. To that effect, proposals for modifications
and extensions of the standard may be submitted by anyone. Three new
proposals for rigid and arbitrary grid motions, as well as time-accurate
data, have been reviewed and developed according to the extension
process defined in the new adopted Charter.  These proposals are at
their last stage of approval before being officially incorporated to the
CGNS standard.

<p>
The CGNS standard is also the object of an ISO standardization effort
for Fluid Dynamics data. This project, initiated by the Boeing Company,
has been accepted by the ISO organization and is now advancing to the
third stage of the ISO approval process.
