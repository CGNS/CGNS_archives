This figure shows two overlapping 2-D structured zones.
The zone on the left is 11 by 6, and the zone on the right is 6 by 9.
In this example, the solution in the rightmost zone is retained.
Thus, all the grid points from the leftmost zone in the overlap
region are hole points.
The outermost layer of these points, outlining the hole, are fringe
points.
