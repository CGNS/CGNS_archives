<p>
This figure shows the two-dimensional faces of two abutting
three-dimensional unstructured hexahedral grid cells.
The donor cell face is drawn using solid lines, and is labeled as "HEXA_8
volume element #238".
Its corners are labeled "node 1", "node 2", "node 3", and "node 4".
The receiving cell face is drawn using dashed lines, with one corner
labeled "R" inside the donor cell face.
Arrows are drawn showing that the location of point "R" in the donor
zone is "0.75 in the 1-2 direction" and "0.55 in the 1-4 direction".
