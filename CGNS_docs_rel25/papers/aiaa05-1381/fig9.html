<p>
This is a plot of the write wall clock time in seconds vs the number of
processors.
There are three curves, one for the small-grid case (50&times;50&times;50
in each zone), one for the medium-grid case (150&times;150&times;150 in
each zone), and one for the large-grid case (250&times;250&times;250 in
each zone).
For all three grids, the times increase gradually with the number of
processors.
<ul>
<li> For the small-grid case, the time increases very gradually, from
     nearly 0 for 1 processor to about 1 for 16 processors.
<li> For the medium-grid case, the time increases linearly from about
     3.5 for 1 processor to about 5 for 8 processors, then jumps to 15
     for 16 processors.
<li> For the large-grid case, the time is about 16 for 1 or 2
     processors, jumps to about 20 for 4 or 8 processors, then jumps
     again to about 36 for 16 processors.
</ul>
