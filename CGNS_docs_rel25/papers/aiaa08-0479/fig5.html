<title> Wall time for parallel CGNS I/O using PVFS for the 8.2 and 57 MB data sets </title>

<p>
This is a plot of wall time in seconds vs number of processors.
There are two curves, one for the 8.2 MB dataset and one for the 57 MB
dataset.
The curve for the 8.2 MB dataset starts at a wall time of about 0.25 for
1 processor, dips down to about 0.15 for 4 processors, climbs to 0.5
for 8 processors, then steadily decreases to about 0.15 for 40 or more
processors.
The curve for the 57 MB dataset starts at a wall time of about 2.0 for 1
processor, dips down to about 1.25 for 4 processors, climbs to 3.0 for
8 processors, steadily decreases to about 0.6 for 50 processors, then
increases to 0.8 for 60 processors.
