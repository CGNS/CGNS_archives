This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the storage
of grid coordinates in a CGNS file.
It shows the same node tree as described earlier for the
<a href="fig15.html">figure illustrating the storage of structured grid
coordinates in a CGNS file</a> but with the addition of an Elements_t
node named Elem.

<p>
Below the Elem node are nodes named ElementRange and
ElementConnectivity, both marked with a file icon.

<p>
In the node tree the ElementConnectivity node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Base/Zone 1/Elem", the node name is ElementConnectivity, and the
node label is DataArray_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is I4, the dimensions
value is 20480, and the bytes value is 81920.
The connectivity data is shown in the node data panel.
