This is an image of the ADFviewer main window showing the CGNS file
structure after the second part of the example.
It shows the same node tree as described after the
<a href="fig5.html">first part of the example</a> but with the Main node
expanded.

<p>
Below the Main node is a node named "ZoneType", marked with a file icon,
and nodes named "GridCoordinates", "Prisms", "Pyramids", "Tetrahedra",
"Quadrilaterals", "Triangles", and "ZoneBC", each marked with a folder
icon and collapsed.

<p>
In the node tree the ZoneType node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Base/Main", the node name is ZoneType, and the node label is
ZoneType_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is C1, the dimensions
value is 12, and the bytes value is 12.
The string "Unstructured" is shown in the node data panel.
