This figure illustrates the relationship between the various elements of
CGNS.
On the left is a box representing the CFD application.
It's connected by an arrow, pointing in both directions, to a box
labeled "API" representing the CGNS Application Programming Interface.
A box labeled "SIDS + SIDS-to-ADF Mapping" points into the API,
indicating that the API incorporates the standards and conventions
defined by the SIDS and File Mapping documents.
The API is connected, by an arrow pointing in both directions, to a box
labeled "ADF Core" representing the ADF database management routines.
The ADF Core is similarly connected to a box labeled "Storage Media"
representing the file containing the CGNS database.
