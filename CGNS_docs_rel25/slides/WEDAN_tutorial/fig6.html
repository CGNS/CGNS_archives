This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the use of
nodes with descriptive data, and documenting the dimensional units and
data class.
It shows the same node tree as described in previous figures, but
with the addition of nodes named "Description", "DimensionalUnits",
and "DataClass" below the Example node (the base node for the CGNS
database).

<p>
In the node tree the DataClass node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Example", the node name is DataClass, and the node label is
DataClass_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is C1, the dimensions
value is 30, and the bytes value is 30.
The string "NormalizedByUnknownDimensional" is shown in the node data
panel.
