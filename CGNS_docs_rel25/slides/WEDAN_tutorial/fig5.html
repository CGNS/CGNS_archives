This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the use of
links.
It shows the same node tree as described in previous figures, but now
the GridCoordinates nodes are links to nodes in a different file, and
are thus marked with a link folder icon.

<p>
In the node tree the GridCoordinates node for the Cube zone is
highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Example/Cube", the node name is GridCoordinates, and the node label is
GridCoordinates_t.
In the link description panel, the link file is grid.cgns, and the link
node is "/Example/Cube/GridCoordinates".

<p>
A pop-up window with the window title "Select Link Node" obscures the
data description and node data panels.
This pop-up window shows the node tree in the file grid.cgns, which in
this case has the same structure as the node tree in the current file,
except without the flow solution nodes (and of course in grid.cgns the
GridCoordinates nodes aren't links, and are thus marked with regular
folder icons).
In the pop-up window, the GridCoordinates node for the Cube zone is
highlighted.
