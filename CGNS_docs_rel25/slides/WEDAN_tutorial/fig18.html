<p>
This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the
specification of a solid wall boundary surface.
It shows the same node tree as described in previous figures, but with
the addition of a node named "Walls" below the ZoneBC node for the Cube
zone, marked with a folder icon and expanded.

<p>
Below the Walls node is a node named "PointList", marked with a file
icon.

<p>
In the node tree the Walls node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Example/Cube/ZoneBC", the node name is Walls, and the node label
is BC_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is C1, the dimensions
value is 6, and the bytes value is 6.
The string "BCWall" is shown in the node data panel.
