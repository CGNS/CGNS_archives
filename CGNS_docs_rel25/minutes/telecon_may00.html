<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Telecon Minutes</h2>

11 May 2000<br>
2:00pm Eastern Time

<p>
The meeting was called to order at 2:00 Eastern time.
There were 13 attendees, <a href="#attendees">listed below</a>.

<p>
Bob Bush reviewed the minutes from the March telecon, noting that they
have been posted on the web. Having no comments, the minutes were
approved as posted.

<ul>
<li> A round-table discussion of the current implementation and usage
     status of CGNS in various organizations was held to familiarize the
     Committee with current activities.
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> Introduction of Charlie Towne, NASA GRC, as the new
          documentation focal point. Charlie is currently merging
          the SIDS and the SIDS_additions documents.  He creates the
          document in LaTex, then convert it to PDF. He would be like to
          also build an HTML version. This merging of the 2 documents
          implies reviewing to whole SIDS which was written originally
          only for multi-block. Chris Rumsey, Bob Bush and Diane Poirier
          agreed to help by reviewing the merged document before it is
          posted on the web.
     <br><br>
     <li> Introduction of Don Roberts - AMTEC Engineering: In 1 or 2
          weeks, they are releasing a CGNS reader for Tecplot. Their
          reader supports structured and unstructured data, with
          solutions at cell centers or nodes. Experience to share with
          others: Mentioned that the CGNS libraries should be stable,
          and that they had compatibility problems between library
          versions. Will ask the developer to send more details on this.
     <br><br>
     <li> Introduction of Jamil Appa - BAE and Denis Bertin -
          Aerospatiale (both not present)
     <br><br>
     <li> ISO Status - Bob Bush presented for Boeing St-Louis: The
          work continues. There is an informative meeting planned in
          June between the ISO group and some members of the CGNS
          committee. Are on schedule to present a draft standard at the
          ISO meeting in October 2000. Peter Wilson (Boeing Seattle)
          converted the SIDS to EXPRESS.
     <br><br>
     <li> John Chawner - Pointwise - They have been evaluating CGNS
          since December 1999 and decided to implement it. GridGen
          version 14 will have a CGNS writer.  Would like to volunteer
          to be part of the CGNS Steering Committee. Bob said
          that we will discuss adding new members at the Denver
          conference. Questions he passed along from his developers:
          <br><br>
          <ul>
          <li> Q: Are there any higher level documents to explain how to
               create a CGNS file for a tetra mesh, for example?
               <br>
               A: Such document doesn't exist. The best thing to do is
               to use the examples on the web.
          <li> Q: Is there a data checker to see if the file is CGNS
               compliant?
               <br>
               A: No, but if the file is readable in the CGNS API, or
               if the file was written with the CGNS API, then it is
               necessarily CGNS compliant. The ADF_edit file browser is
               also a good tool for browsing a file and verifying its
               content.
          </ul>
     <br>
     <li> Michel Delanaye - Numeca - Numeca software released at the
          end of April 2000 included their implementation of CGNS for
          structured meshes and solutions.  They are working now on
          implementing the interblock connectivity. Wants to present
          a proposal for hierarchical elements in June. Steve Karman
          (Lockeed) agreed to work with Michel on this proposal. Passed
          along comments from his chemisty specialist who would like
          CGNS to
          <br><br>
          <ul>
          <li> interface with Chemkin
          <li> Have curve fitting enthalpy and Cp
          <li> Complex kinematics scheme
          <li> Bob Bush suggested that we start with what we have, then
               we can work on an extension proposal.
          </ul>
     </ul>
<br>
<li> <b>Extension Status (Diane Poirier)</b>
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> Web site enhancements: Add pages to collect data sets,
          utilities and comments/experiences.
     <br><br>
     <li> Linux port: First release on April 26. It is being used by MTU
          in Munich and by L.A.N.L.
     <br><br>
     <li> LINUX problem: gives memory error when using
          <tt>cg_goto_f(...)</tt> and compiling the Fortran application
          with the g77 compiler, but only when format statement for
          prints is inside parenthesis. Works OK when separate format
          statement is used.  For example:
          <br><br>
          <ul>
          <li> Syntax that creates memory errors in function
               <tt>cg_goto_f</tt> using g77 compiler:
<pre>
      write(6,'(a,i3)') 'a=',a
</pre>
          <li> Syntax that doesn't create any memory errors:
<pre>
      write(6,10) 'a=',a
10    format(a,i3)
</pre>
          </ul> 
     <li> Released - Unstructured Element Ordering on March 15.
     <br><br>
     <li> Status - Moving Grid specification: the CGNS lib version 1.3
          is planned to be release in July and to include the API for
          moving grid.
     <br><br>
     <li> Doug McCarthy to check if Boeing - St Louis has made any
          headway with ADF linking problems.
     </ul>
<br>
<li> <b>Solicit implementation paper for Reno 2000 (Bob Bush)</b> -
     Most people not prepared to submit abstract for Reno 2001 on
     CGNS implementations. Diane is planning a CGNS performance paper
     however. Many agreed that an informal gathering/demo/discussion of
     CGNS implementations at Reno may be feasible.
<br><br>
<li> <b>June Meeting (Bob Bush)</b>
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> Rescheduled for Wednesday night, tentatively at 7 p.m.  Advise
          all to look for posting of room and time in Denver.
     <br><br>
     <li> Items on the agenda
          <br><br>
          <ul>
          <li> Discuss addition of new members of the steering committee
          <li> Plan and schedule for development through Jan 2000
          <li> Implementation and release status reports
          <li> Documentation status report
          <li> Extensions status report
          </ul>
     </ul>
</ul>
