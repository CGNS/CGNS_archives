<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Telecon Minutes</h2>

25 October 2000<br>
2:00pm Eastern Time<br><br>

<p>
The meeting was called to order at 2:00 Eastern time.
There were 14 attendees, <a href="#attendees">listed below</a>.

<p>
The minutes of the 24 August meeting were reviewed and approved as
posted on the web site.

<ul>
<li> <b>Steering Committee Nominations</b> - The process for adding new
     voting members to the Steering Committee this year will be for
     the Chairperson to collect nominations and develop a recommended
     slate of candidates for addition and removal from the list. This
     slate will be discussed and revised at the December telecon, and
     approved at the January face to face meeting. At present, there
     are 13 voting members. Two additional candidates have been put
     forward: Alexandre Corjon of Aerospatiale Matra Airbus and Greg
     Power of AEDC (potentially representing the US Air Force). These
     additions would put the membership at 15, what is called for
     in the Charter.  Additional recommendations are solicited. At
     present there is no need to expand the number of members beyond the
     Charter, or to ask organizations to step down.
<br><br>
<li> <b>ISO Status</b> - Ray Cosner sent Bob Bush input on the meeting
     of the ISO committee in October since he was unable to attend
     the telecon. The meeting went well, although it was decided to
     postpone Gates 2 and 3. Gate 3 requires full documentation that
     is not yet in final form. It is hoped that this will be ready for
     the February meeting, although it may slip into June. There was no
     difficulty with the CGNS content, the primary remaining actions
     are to re-format and generate documentation in a form suitable
     for the ISO community. Ray provided the current drafts for those
     interested. There was a request to post them on the web site. Bob
     will ask Ray if it is appropriate to post them on the web, either
     with a direct link from the CGNS web site, or under an unpublished
     site to be distributed to the extended Steering Committee.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Documentation</b> - Charlie Towne announced that the SIDS
     Version 2 Beta 1 has been completed and posted. The addition of
     time accurate and iterative data will be released with the software
     as Beta 2 in mid November. Beta 3 will include a merging of the
     file-mapping document into the SIDS, and the current chemistry
     extensions.  This should be ready by the end of the year. It was
     suggested that we announce and release Version 2 at the January
     meeting/conference.
     
     <p>
     Chris Rumsey said the draft version of the User's Guide is
     almost ready. This includes some sample code, which he will also
     release. The software will be released both with the User's Guide,
     and under the Utilities web site. Comments are solicited
     when the Draft User's Guide is released.
     
     <p>
     David Edwards, reporting for Steve Legensky, stated that the paper
     abstract for a CGNS applications paper should be ready by 31
     October. A survey to collect information for the paper was sent to
     CGNS users with responses due by 7 November. This data will be used
     for the paper, and <b>responses by all parties is requested</b>. We
     responded to a request from the AIAA Aerospace America year in
     review - <a href="#AAarticle">Interactive Computer Graphics</a>
     for a contribution to an article.
<br><br>
<li> <b>User Support</b> - No volunteers for Support Focal Point
     have come forward. There are about 400 registered CGNS users at
     present. A 'ListBot' e-mail user forum has been set up, accessible
     from the web site. To date only a few people have signed up.
     Members are encouraged to utilize this site for user support and
     discussion.
     
     <p>
     Steve Feldman suggested contacting the 'owner' of CFD-Online to see
     if we could or should add a CGNS forum to that popular site. There
     being general support for the idea, Steve will contact them.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Extensions</b> - Diane Poirier reported that grid motion API
     programming is almost complete, only testing and documentation
     remains before an expected mid November release as V2beta2. She
     also hopes to have the chemistry extension implemented by the end
     of the year for release of V2beta3. The rest of the extensions are
     in various states of readiness, and will be implemented in the API
     for potential release in V3 next year.
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> <b>Hierarchical Structures</b> - Michel Delanaye is
          implementing an application specific version for internal
          purposes, and would like feedback on the proposal as soon as
          possible to get general agreement for an official extension to
          the standard. Diane reported that M. Aftomis (Spelling?) is
          preparing a counter proposal for review.  Fluent has reviewed
          the proposal, and it looks like it should meet their needs.
          Adapco will also look more closely at the proposal to ensure
          it meets their needs.

          <p>
          A discussion of the need for summary information
          followed. After some discussion it became clear there is a
          need for summary information that describes the content of a
          particular file. A consensus seemed to form around the idea
          of a utility that would scan the file for its contents, and
          another utility that would use this information to classify
          the information. Given the classification, applications could
          make assumptions about the file and avoid messy checks for
          data availability. There is a need for a classification system
          (e.g. solution with conservation variables, non-dimensional
          structured grid, heirarchical structures with at most 2
          children,?). There were no volunteers to develop this system,
          but it was agreed that we should continue to pursue the idea,
          the classification system and the utilities.
     <br><br>
     <li> <b>Chemistry</b> - Ed Hall forwarded some concerns about
          the proposed extension, primarily centered on missing data
          (thermodynamic properties of species, reaction rates,
          etc.). Ed was not available at the telecon, but Bob indicated
          that he responded that it was hoped that this information
          would be the subject of future extensions. Bob will contact
          Ed to inquire if the current extension does not preclude the
          future (or application specific) addition of the information
          he requires. Assuming this to be the case, we propose
          implementing the extension as described, and soliciting future
          extensions.
     <br><br>
     <li> <b>Misc. extensions</b> - These are ready for implementation,
          but have had no comment. The implementation will be held for V3.
          <br><br>
          <ul>
          <li> Spray-2phase flow - There is a draft out for
               comment. The team (Darian) solicits comments on the
               proposed content. The proposal needs to be refined more
               fully defining the proposed data structures. Ed Ascoli
               will request this refinement from Armen Darian.
          <li> Hanging Nodes - Dave Edwards indicated that they
               should have a proposal by the first of December.
          <li> Wall functions and Turbomachinery Boundary Conditions -
               Bob Bush indicated that he has taken no action on these
               extensions, but will try to revive and push them forward
               soon. Anyone interested in more immediate action is
               encouraged to participate.
          <li> API Link Support - Chris Rumsey has requested
               API support for links. He has a rough proposal. Due to
               priorities, we will try to implement early next year.
          </ul>
     </ul>
<br>
<li> <b>Additional Items</b> - Bob Bush will arrange the next telecon
     for the first week of December. We will discuss the agenda for the
     January meeting.
</ul>

<p>
The January meeting is tenatively scheduled for Monday night at Reno.

<b>Interactive Computer Graphics</b>

<p>
Outstanding developments in Y2K included: collaborative systems for
better utilization of graphics hardware, co-processing systems for
visualizing large-scale simulations, an emerging ISO standard for CFD
data exchange, and commercialization of automatic feature extraction
tools.

<p>
Many aerospace companies and government laboratories have established
Visualization Lab's that contain specialized SGI graphics workstations
to generate hi-resolution computer graphics images. These labs have been
poorly utilized in the past because engineers often had to travel great
distances to use the graphics hardware. This situation is rapidly
changing as vendors adapt their software to utilize the Internet and
corporate intranets. For example, EnLiten is a new product from
Computational Engineering International (CEI) that allows high-end
visualizations to be easily and cost-effectively shared throughout an
enterprise. EnLiten supports 3D stereo viewing and a full range of
computing and display systems, from notebook computers to workstations
to semi-immersive environments such as the NCSA ImmersaDesk. It plugs
into well-known browsers and viewers such as MS Internet Explorer, MS
PowerPoint, and Netscape.

<p>
Parallel computing is rapidly emerging as the method of choice for
visualizing large-scale CFD solutions. Intelligent Light has built upon
MIT's pV3 client-server infrastructure with the popular Fieldview
software. The result is a fully supported, robust commercial "graphics
client" for the pV3 system. pV3 is used throughout the world for
visualization co-processing, that is, concurrent simulation and
interactive visualization. Intelligent Light's implementation supports
systems ranging from laptop Windows PC's through UNIX clusters and
supercomputers and enables enterprise-wide visualization.

<p>
Every CFD code that enters the marketplace generates datasets with a
slightly different format than their competitor. Products that utilize
these datasets, i.e., pre- and post-processing software, have to support
approximately 50 different file formats at the present time. The lack of
standardization forces vendors to spend an inordinate amount of time
implementing and maintaining file exchange software. To combat this
software crisis, a consortium of CFD users and vendors have adopted a
formal standard for exchanging CFD data called the CFD General Notation
System (CGNS). The CGNS system facilitates the exchange of data between
sites and applications, and stabilizes the archiving of aerodynamic
data. An Application Program Interface, implemented by ICEM CFD
Engineering, is platform independent and simplifies the installation of
CGNS in C, C++, and Fortran applications. CGNS was conceived back in
1994 as a means to promote "plug-and-play" CFD via a file specification
standard and supporting code that could be distributed freely. In 2000,
the CGNS Steering Committee affiliated with AIAA as a subcommittee,
made progress in proposing CGNS as an ISO standard, and added
capabilities to the standard to handle increasingly specialized and
complex meshes. Currently, there are over 20 CFD applications that
support or have translators for CGNS. Further information about this
effort can be found at http://www.cgns.org/.

<p>
Automatic feature extraction tools have transitioned from research
institutions to commercial vendors of post-processing software in the
past six months. The open-source FX (Feature eXtraction) library
released by MIT in June 2000, has been adopted by two leading suppliers
of CFD visualization software; Intelligent Light (Fieldview) and CEI
(Ensight). Feature extraction tools automatically deduce the location,
shape, and strength of specific features without human intervention, and
do so in substantially less time than their human counterpart. This is a
different paradigm than typical graphical analysis methods where the
engineer has to do the work, interpreting the data from imagery and
using their insight or experience to infer and find specific patterns.
Feature extraction algorithms are programmed with domain-specific
knowledge, so they do not require a-priori knowledge of places to look
for interesting behavior. The latest feature extraction tools, developed
at MIT and NASA Ames, automatically calculate vortex cores, separation
and re-attachment lines, and shock surfaces. These tools will be
available in Fieldview 7 and Ensight Gold in the final quarter of Y2K.
