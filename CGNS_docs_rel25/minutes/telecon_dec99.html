<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Telecon Minutes</h2>

9 December 1999<br>
12:00pm Eastern Time

<p>
The meeting was called to order at 12:00 Eastern time.
There were 10 attendees, <a href="#attendees">listed below</a>.

<ul>
<li> <b>Outstanding Items</b>
     <p>
     The steering Committee meeting in Reno is Monday night, 6:30 PM
     in Carson 1. It is opened to anyone else interested. Depending on
     attendance, Diane may or may not give a CGNS overview presentation
     at the beginning of the meeting.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Charter Revisions</b>
     <p>
     Steve Legensky, president of Intelligent Light, would like
     to be active on the CGNS Steering Committee. His company is
     willing to provide funding and/or a body to work on CGNS software
     development. At Reno, the committee will vote to add Intelligent
     Light (and others?) to the Steering Committee.

     <p>
     According to Diane, DASA/MTU and NUMECA are not decided yet about
     joining.

     <p>
     When the committee deals with Fluent, it should deal with Barb from
     now on (she is now their contact point).

     <p>
     Pointwise (Gridgen) is very interested, but not committed to join
     at this point. John Chawner will attend the Reno meeting.

     <p>
     Outreach Committee will contact S.W. Research Inst. (Steve will
     provide Barb with name of contact) regarding their interest in
     CGNS. Outreach Committee should also continue to feel out DASA/MTU
     and NUMECA.
<br><br>
<li> <b>AIAA Position Paper</b>
     <p>
     Will change "affiliate" with other organizations to "associate"
     (will only "affiliate" with AIAA).

     <p>
     Bob will attend the Committee on Standards (CoS) meeting at Reno
     (Rm 153, 7PM Tuesday).

     <p>
     CoS may want to form by-laws in the future (there are none
     now).
<br><br>
<li> <b>Funding</b>
     <p>
     Mostly discussion during this section:
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> not sure precisely how to proceed with getting funding yet
     <li> requirements perhaps too vague at this point - need to develop
          more specific Statements of Work?
     <li> 2 types of work: fundamental/utility and customizing (e.g. NPSS)
     <li> to go after future NASA or Boeing funding, we will need to
          put forward specific proposal(s)
     <li> if we can first find funding sources, then we can tailor
          Statements of Work to these sources
     <li> a possibility is Nat. Inst. of Standards (NIST) - best if get
          a place like NIST to fund the overall project, rather than get
          several places funding small pieces; for example, no one will
          want to fund "WEB maintenance"
     </ul>

     <p>
     Steve reiterated his company's commitment to provide a person
     and/or funding for future software development.

     <p>
     Bob will serve as collection point for further ideas regarding
     funding.

     <p>
     More discussion will take place at the Reno meeting.
<br><br>
<li> <b>ISO</b>
     <p>
     CGNS is through 1st gate, but we will need more international votes
     to get through next gate.

     <p>
     Possibly 2 years to get CFD standard formalized.

     <p>
     Everyone: start forwarding potential international contact info to
     Ray immediately.

     <p>
     STEP:AP - we are working closely with this team.

     <p>
     Major issue: CGNS ADF currently too slow - it was evaluated by
     Aerospatiale and they rejected adoption because of this issue
     (a function of the number of ADF nodes). The standard is really
     separate from the software, but many will not adopt it if the
     software is slow.

     <p>
     We should immediately add a task to address this issue directly.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Extensions</b>
     <p>
     Some discussion on existing "patched" connectivity method - may
     need to enhance in order to handle different methodologies; also,
     discussion on hybrid grids and semi-structured grids (layered near
     bodies).

     <p>
     New proposals are on WEB site - members need to look at and
     comment.
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> Rigid motion, deforming motion, and time accurate are all
          ready to implement - comment on them SOON!
     <li> Other proposals are not as far along.
     </ul>
</ul>
