<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Telecon Minutes</h2>

2 August 2005<br>
11:00 AM Eastern Time

<p>
<ol>
<li> The meeting was called to order at 11:05 AM.  There were
     <a href="#attendees">8 attendees</a>, listed below.
<p>
<li> The minutes of the <a href="telecon_may05.html">25 May 2005
     meeting</a> were approved as posted on the web site.
<p>
<li> Status of previous action items:
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Towne will incorporate Vice-Chair changes into the charter and
          post.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Done.
          </ul>
     <li> Rumsey will forward to Hunten the e-mails of the members on
          the <i>hdf5cgns@ncsa.uiuc.edu</i> mailing list.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Done.
          </ul>
     <li> Hunten will send a copy of his planning documentation to
          Rumsey, for inclusion as an attachment to these minutes.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Done.  These are attached to the May 2005 minutes.
          </ul>
     <li> Hauser will provide a list of issues that need to be discussed
          with the NCSA (HDF5) people.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> The only remaining major issues are the two already
               known: (a) HDF5 has slower I/O for files with many
               (thousands of) nodes and (b) HDF5 files tend to be
               significantly larger than ADF files.  No additional
               issues need to be raised. Action item dropped.
          </ul>
     <li> Towne will upgrade Poinot's SIDS-to-HDF5 documentation with
          2.4 additions and post after V2.4 comes online.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Not done yet. Document needs to be modified to read V2.4
               (rather than 3.0), and statement "CGNS versions prior to
               v3.x used the ADF storage manager" needs to be deleted
               or modified. Also, SIDS-to-ADF documentation needs
               to continue to be posted for the foreseeable future.
               <u>Action item carries.</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Wedan will make change in CGNS HDF5 software so viewer can
          read (see) character strings in the HDF5 files.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Done, but not tested/available yet.  Action item carries.
          </ul>
     <li> Wedan will complete changes for V2.4 and will announce when
          ready.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Almost ready. Initial download page still needs to be
               updated.  <u>Action item carries.</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Allmaras will write up an example of how to use existing
          standard for unstructured face-based connectivity, and send to
          Rumsey to pass on to the Committee.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Done.  There was a lot of discussion on this issue,
               which deals with a method of using face-based data
               structures with parents defined, for handling polyhedral
               unstructured cells.  This method is apparently
               SIDS-compliant, although it was not originally an
               intended method for general use. The method works, but
               there is still some missing information that Allmaras
               currently puts in as <tt>UserDefined</tt> nodes.
               Continuing to allow this method puts some additional
               workload on CGNS readers which at this point are probably
               not looking for it, but on the positive side it does
               allow users to write polyhedral cells easily without the
               necessity of adding/coding a new extension.  Allmaras
               said that it is already easy to determine, by looking at
               the file, whether the face-based method is being used or
               not. <u>Allmaras will write explicit documentation, for
               addition to the SIDS, describing face-based storage and
               providing explicit examples for using the method, and
               will send to Rumsey and Michal for review.</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Wedan will change the MLL to return element list instead of
          point list when appropriate.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> This item had to do with eliminating the
               <tt>Pointlist/Range + CellCenter</tt> possibility -
               and thus removing the need for GridLocation under
               <tt>BC_t</tt>. The idea was to have the API automatically
               make the alteration, transparent to the user.  Wedan was
               not sure if this specific task had been done yet or not.
               <u>Action item carries.</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Rumsey and Poinot to coordinate some type of "Intro to CGNS"
          for Reno 2006 or for AIAA's summer 2006 meeting.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Ongoing. Current plan is to do nothing at Reno, but hold
               a Panel Discussion (something like "CGNS in Industry")
               at AIAA's June 2006 meeting in San Francisco. Poinot is
               arranging for several industry representatives to attend,
               give brief talks, and answer questions. Apparently there
               are not many industrial users yet in the U.S. (other than
               Boeing to some degree)... most activity is occurring in
               Europe. Michal said that someone at Boeing would probably
               be willing to serve on the panel.  Rumsey and Poinot
               also plan to tentatively coordinate an evening tutorial
               session. <u>Action item carries.</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Towne will check to see if old documentation is stored on
          SourceForge. He will make sure future "old versions" also get
          put there.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Done.  The old documentation is there, starting with
               Version 2.2. <u>As soon as V2.4 comes on line, Towne will
               bundle up V2.3 documentation for Wedan to post.</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Norris will try to work with the (currently commented)
          Rind-for-unstructured fixes and see if they meet his needs.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Not done yet. <u>Action item carries.</u> There was
               some discussion on whether to officially implement
               this capability now, or to wait (because of loss of
               forward compatibility).  It was decided to wait, to give
               Norris a chance to try it and also because there is no
               documentation on this capability yet. <u>Wedan will write
               documentation for SIDS on Rind-for-unstructured and send
               to Rumsey and Norris.</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Hann will send his proposed changes for decoupling the MLL
          from ADF and HDF5 to Poinot, Rumsey, Wedan, and Allmaras, to
          get their opinion on it.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Done.  According to our <a href="#HDF_policy">draft
               policy statement regarding HDF-5</a>, even once we
               officially announce HDF-5 as the official recommended
               storage format, we will continue to support ADF
               capability for the foreseeable future.  Hann's method may
               be the best way to handle this in the future.  Currently,
               the user can choose between ADF and HDF-5 at compile
               time.  There was also some discussion for eventually
               providing "stubs" so users can avoid HDF-5 entirely if
               desired, but if HDF-5 is to be our official recommended
               method, then this probably is not a good idea (the
               "stubs" could be done for those who ask for it, but not
               widely advertised and not part of the V3.0 distribution
               package).
          </ul>
     <li> Poinot and Wedan will work to resolve issue of "link of links"
          problem with our HDF5 implementation.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Not done. <u>Action item carries.</u>
          </ul>
     <a name="item3o"></a>
     <li> Rumsey will send McMorris & Brouillet e-mails to Michal, and
          Michal will contact them about need for <tt>GridLocation =
          FaceCenter</tt> for zone-to-zone connectivity.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Done, but there does not appear to be enough interest (or
               time) for anyone to propel this idea forward by writing
               a proposal for extension and following it through.
               Therefore, this item will be tabled for now.
          </ul>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Open Items (<a href="#item13">number 13 below</a>):
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Regarding <a href="#HDF5_todo">HDF-5 "to do" list</a>, it is
          no longer a necessity that HDF-5 fix "creation tracking", so
          this item was taken off the list.  Also, the SIDS-to-HDF5
          documentation is complete, so that item was also removed.
     <li> Regarding the issue of alphanumeric sorting: HDF-5 does this
          automatically, so this item becomes a non-issue once HDF-5
          becomes the recommended official storage mechanism.  It does
          not appear to be worthwhile to pursue it for ADF nodes outside
          the Zone nodes (for which it is already done). Item removed
          from list of Open Items.
     <li> Regarding CGNS license, the decision was made (via e-mail
          voting) to switch to the zlib license. Therefore this item
          removed from Open Item list. <u>Wedan will change the license
          in the software and on the website to zlib, and will forward
          appropriate wording to Towne.  Also, Towne will change the
          license in the documentation
          (<a href="../charter/index.html">Charter</a> and anywhere else
          it appears).</u>
     <li> Regarding <tt>PYRA</tt> element needed, this change definitely
          needs to wait for Version 3.0, because it changes the enums,
          and forward compatibility is lost in a major way.

          corrected in the on-line version, which Towne will want to
          pass on to AIAA for its next Recommended Practice.
     <li> Because NASA Glenn is transitioning its e-mail services to an
          Agency-level service, the CGNStalk address is being changed
          to: <i>CGNStalk@lists.nasa.gov</i> (effective immediately).

<h2>Draft CGNS Policy Statement regarding HDF-5</h2>

<p>
The CGNS implementation of SIDS, so-called MLL, was originally built
using a file format called ADF (Advanced Data Format).  This format was
based on a common file format system previously in use at McDonnell
Douglas.  The ADF has worked extremely well, requiring little repair,
upgrade, or maintenance over the last decade.

<p>
However, ADF does not have parallel or compression capability, and does
not have the support and tools HDF5 offers.  Also, HDF5, supported by
the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), has rapidly
grown to become a world-wide format standard for storing scientific
data.  HDF5 has parallel capability as well as a broader support base
than ADF.

<p>
Therefore, the CGNS Steering Committee has made the decision to adopt
HDF5 as the default (official) data storage mechanism.  We are currently
in the process of making the switch.  In doing so, however, we have
learned that there are some issues associated with usage of HDF5: it has
slower I/O for files with many (thousands of) nodes, and its file sizes
tend to be significantly larger than ADF files in general.  These issues
make the switch more complicated, but we have decided to count on NCSA
to continue to improve HDF5 and hopefully eliminate the problems at some
point in the future.

<p>
We have also learned that it is possible to easily support both ADF and
HDF5 formats simultaneously, giving the user the capability to choose
between them.

<p>
Therefore, we have decided to continue forward with the "switch", with
the following as our goal:

<p>
The CGNS Steering Committee considers HDF5 to be its official,
recommended storage format.  However, ADF will continue to be available
for use, with the CGNS mid-level library capable of (1) using either
format and (2) translating back and forth between the two.
