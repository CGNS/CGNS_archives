<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Telecon Minutes</h2>

16 March 2000<br>
2:00pm Eastern Time

<p>
The meeting was called to order at 2:00 Eastern time.
There were 18 attendees, <a href="#attendees">listed below</a>.

<p>
Bob Bush reviewed the minutes from the January meeting, noting that
they have been posted on the web. Having no comments, the minutes were
approved as posted. Bob also noted that following the January meeting, a
presentation was made to the AIAA CFD Committee on Standards proposing
to affiliate with that organization. The proposal was accepted, and we
are now a sub-committee of this organization.

<ul>
<li> A round-table discussion of the current implementation and usage
     status of CGNS in various organizations was held to familiarize the
     Committee with current activities.  The high points are summarized
     here.
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> Intelligent Light - Dave Edwards - IL is planning to release
          a CGNS reader for their primary product in the July time
          frame. During this effort, they will assess performance
          and identify areas for improvement. One area is likely to
          be incorporation of their 'Data Guide' technology to speed
          access to large data sets.  During the installation process
          they also anticipate needing additional utilities. They hope
          to provide these utilities to the CGNS community. This led
          to some discussion of how to provide and support additional
          utilities. This will need to be explored further. Steve
          Legensky also offered to help with a web list of CGNS
          contacts. See the <a href="#intelligentlight">viewgraph
          presented by Dave Edwards</a>.
     <br><br>
     <li> ADAPCO - Scott Ochs - ADAPCO is in the process of
          transitioning to CGNS, and can currently read and write
          grids and solutions (structured and unstructured). Their
          next step is to utilize the mixed element capability, and
          store time accurate data.  The capability is already in beta
          release, with a more complete release planned in a couple of
          months. They expressed an interest in obtaining 'sample' codes
          to help in the transition. This led to a discussion of the
          possibility of creating a place on the web where sample code
          can be posted. Scott (and Steve Feldman) also raised a problem
          they were having with the <tt>cg_goto</tt> function on IBM
          systems. Others on the line who had used IBM systems have not
          experienced similar problems. They will continue to try and
          identify the problem.
     <br><br>
     <li> AMTEC - Diane Poirier noted that Tecplot now has a CGNS
          reader. Release date is unknown.
     <br><br>
     <li> Fluent - Barb Hutchings - Barb noted that Fluent has
          downloaded the documentation, and assigned a programmer to
          begin implementation. They anticipate a release of the ability
          to read and write information in V5.5, which should occur in
          the third quarter of 2000.
     <br><br>
     <li> NUMECA - Michel Delanaye - NUMECA is adopting CGNS for all
          their products.  They currently have a full implementation
          in their grid generator, with the exception of the boundary
          condition information. The structured code also uses it for
          the solution (but again not coupling information yet. They
          would like to include unsteady data as soon as the capability
          is available. They would also like the ability to store
          planes of solution data (they were referred to the Boeing
          discussion to come). They anticipate a March release to their
          user base. NUMECA has also been active convincing various
          consortia to adopt CGNS as the data exchange standard. New
          capabilities required include new element types (e.g.
          hanging nodes) and potentially octree information. For
          <a href="#numeca">more details</a>, see below.
     <br><br>
     <li> Lockheed - Steve Karman - Also mentioned the need for hanging
          node information.
     <br><br>
     <li> Boeing - Todd Michal - Boeing has a structured grid
          implementation of CGNS in a pre-release version of Wind. They
          anticipate including unstructured grid capability, utilities
          and post processing capability this year, and a release to
          NPARC user community next year. Boeing is also bringing in
          Overflow and CFL3D versions, which utilize CGNS. They have
          made a proposal for storing boundary planes, which will be
          distributed for discussion as an extension proposal.
     <br><br>
     <li> RocketDyne - Armen Darian - RocketDyne has converted a
          rotating machinery post-processor to use CGNS.
     <br><br>
     <li> Vircinity - Andreas Wierse - We introduced Andreas Wierse
          who gave an overview of Vircinity, a visualization and
          post-processing capability with emphasis on virtual
          reality. They are looking at CGNS, and should decide on a
          development plan soon, and assign a CGNS contact point. They
          also have contacts with the EU and will bring CGNS to their
          attention.
     </ul>
<br>
<li> <b>Extension Status (Diane Poirier)</b>
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> The unstructured grid element ordering extension has
          been implemented and is on the web. Documentation is
          underway. ADAPCO is utilizing already.
     <br><br>
     <li> The moving grid proposal is finished and ready for
          implementation.
     <br><br>
     <li> The chemistry proposal is still stalled. Suggested to finalize
          as is, and extend in the future if a more comprehensive
          standard is required.
     <br><br>
     <li> Diane also brought up the need for a documentation focal
          point. Anyone interested please contact Diane or Bob Bush.
     <br><br>
     <li> Steve Legensky offered to take on some of the testing on
          multiple platforms to relieve Diane of this aspect of the
          development.
     </ul>
<br>
<li> <b>June Meeting</b> - There was a brief discussion of the June
     meeting, and it was decided to coordinate with the AIAA CFD CoS
     with the CGNS team meeting first, and reporting out at the CoS
     meeting. (Subsequent contact with Ray Cosner has identified
     that our meeting night will be Tuesday, with the CoS meeting on
     Wednesday night. Please plan accordingly!)

<h2>Report from NUMECA</h2>

<tt>
Subject: NUMECA input
<br><br><br>
Bob,

<p>
I thought you would be interested to get something written about what
I said during the last teleconference. So, NUMECA is adopting the CGNS
format as the only data transfer system between its different products,
IGG (multi-block structured grid generation), Euranus (multi-block
structured flow solver), CFView (postprocessing, visualization).

<p>
So far, the grid coordinates are written in the data base, the topology
is still stored in our own format, but we are progressively changing
to CGNS for the complete set of information, connectivity, boundary
conditions, etc. This should be completed fairly soon.  The flow solver
outputs solutions in the CGNS database, and the database can be read by
CFView. For unsteady computations, solutions at different time steps are
stored for the moment in a different file. The CGNS will be part of the
next release of these products, i.e. end of March.

<p>
We have proposed the use of CGNS in two European research projects. The
CGNS format has been adopted in the first one, HPNURSA, to study
unsteady flows in turbomachinery. Partners in this project are TaskFlow,
SIMULOG which is writing a CGNS reader for Ensight, SEP, HYRDO-Vevay,
EPFL and Ecole Centrale de Lyon. In the second one, ESTEDI, we proposed
to test the CGNS format as a possible way to store data in a very large
data base which is intended for data posttreatment (data mining) for
large scientific computations (Climate modeling, Cosmology, Satellite
tracking, LES, etc).

<p>
I mentioned some problems regarding speed. Further investigation on
our side has highlighted some bad usage which has been corrected
since. I also mentioned our wish to be able to store quantities on
block boundaries. The Boeing proposal will most propably meet our
expectations. The last comment was about the ability to store our
hierarchal hexahedral unstructured grids. On this matter, I am going to
investigate different possibilities and probably contact Diane with some
propositions.

<p>
Hope this will help,

<br><br>
-Michel
