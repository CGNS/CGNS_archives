<p>
This is a box chart showing the high-level connectivity between
different elements in the engineering design, analysis, and
manufacturing process.
There are six boxes, labeled as follows.
<ul>
<li> Computer Aided Design
<li> Finite Element Modeling
<li> Finite Element Analysis
<li> Composite Producibility
<li> Composite Ply Boundary and Stacking Optimization
<li> Detail Analysis
</ul>

<p>
Connections between elements are shown using double-ended arrows drawn
between boxes.
<ul>
<li> "Computer Aided Design" connects to "Finite Element Modeling",
     "Composite Producibility", "Composite Ply Boundary and Stacking
     Optimization", and "Detail Analysis".
<li> "Finite Element Modeling" connects to all the other boxes.
<li> "Finite Element Analysis" connects to "Finite Element Modeling"
     and "Detail Analysis".
<li> "Composite Producibility" connects to "Computer Aided Design",
     "Finite Element Modeling", "Detail Analysis", and "Composite Ply
     Boundary and Stacking Optimization".
<li> "Composite Ply Boundary and Stacking Optimization" connects to
     "Composite Producibility", "Computer Aided Design", "Finite Element
     Modeling", and "Detail Analysis".
<li> "Detail Analysis" connects to all the other boxes.
</ul>
