This chart shows the organization within ISO of the existing Fluid
Dynamics Standard, with the proposed additions.

<p>
At the top are the new areas "Usage Guide for AP237" and "AP237, Fluid
Dynamics Data".

<p>
Below AP237 is the new area "Part 110, CFD Models".
Below that are the following.
<ul>
<li> Part 50, Mathematical Constructs
<li> Part 52, Mesh-Based Data
<li> Part 53, Numerical Analysis
</ul>
Of these, only Part 50 already exists.

<p>
Finally, at the bottom is "Part 21, Clear-Text Encoding".
This already exists, but needs to be extended to include binary data.

<p>
Each of the new parts must be carried individually through the approval
process.
The lower-level parts will lead the way.
