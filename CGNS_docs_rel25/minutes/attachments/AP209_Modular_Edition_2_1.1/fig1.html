This is a complicated "bubble" chart showing the high-level composition
of AP209E2, and the connections between the various modules.
Moving more or less from top to bottom:

<ul>
<li> The "AP209E2" bubble connects to modules labeled "Mechanical CAD
     (AP203E2)" and "Analysis".
<li> "Analysis" connects to "Mesh Model".
<li> "Mesh Model" connects to "Structured Mesh Model", "Unstructured
     Mesh Model", "FEA Model", "PDM + Work Authorization + Engineering
     Analysis", and "Analysis Report".
<li> "PDM + Work Authorization + Engineering Analysis" connects to "FEA
     Model" and "PDM + Geometric Placement".
<li> "Mechanical CAD (AP203E2)" connects to "PDM + Geometric Placement".
<li> "Structured Mesh Model" connects to "Analysis Control" and "EACM
     Fields and Properties".
<li> "Unstructured Mesh Model" connects to "Analysis Control" and "EACM
     Fields and Properties".
<li> "FEA Model" connects to "EACM Fields and Properties", "FE Analysis
     Control", "Composite Definition, Shape and Structure", and
     "Material Specification and Representation".
<li> "Material Specification and Representation" connects to "EACM
     Fields and Properties", "Composite Definition, Shape and
     Structure", and "PDM + Geometric Placement".
<li> "PDM + Geometric Placement" connects to "Shape Representation" and
     "Composite Definition, Shape and Structure".
<li> "Analysis Control" connects to "Analysis Results".
<li> "EACM Fields and Properties" connects to "Analysis Control", "FE
     Analysis Control", and "FE Analysis Results".
<li> "FE Analysis Control" connects to "FE Analysis Results".
<li> "Analysis Results" connects to "Analysis Report".
<li> "FE Analysis Results" connects to "Analysis Report".
<li> "Shape Representation" connects to "Composite Definition, Shape and
     Structure".
</ul>
