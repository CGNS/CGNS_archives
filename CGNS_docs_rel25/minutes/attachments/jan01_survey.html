<h2>Raw Data</h2>

<ul>
<li> 360 Surveys Sent Out
<li> 84 "Responses" of which 45 were "bounces"
<li> Therefore, 39 usable responses
     <ul>
     <li> 16 Commercial
     <li> 11 Universities
     <li> 6 NASA/National Labs
     <li> 2 Solver Cos.
     <li> 2 Grid generation
     <li> 2 Post-processing
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Commercial Responses</h2>

<ul>
<li> Location = 8 US, 8 European
     <ul>
     <li> 0 in production
     <li> 2 using and having some impact
     <li> 2 haven't tried it yet
     <li> 12 in various stages of trying it
     </ul>
<li> Solver/Motivation
     <ul>
     <li> 11 with in-house/government codes
     <li> 5 want it for commercial codes
     <li> Universal desire: share data between codes
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>NASA/National Lab Responses</h2>

<ul>
<li> 4 from NASA, 1 Sandia, 1 LANL
     <ul>
     <li> 0 using and having some impact
     <li> 2 haven't tried it yet
     <li> 4 in various stages of trying it
     </ul>
<li> Main Issues
     <ul>
     <li> Lack of full pre/post suites to support operation
     <li> Poor operation in parallel environment
     <li> Lack of time to implement
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Other Observations</h2>

<ul>
<li> People generally want to interchange data
     <ul>
     <li> Some European organizations using just ADF
     <li> Interchange between copmmercial solvers is the key for
          industrial respondents
     <li> Some people have experienced small incompatibility problems
     </ul>
<li> Issues people have raised
     <ul>
     <li> Complaints about "heaviness of CGNS"
     <li> Problems with complexity and structure of documentation
     <li> Some link problems under Windows & LINUX
     <li> Poor implementation of BC's and unstructured data tyoes
     </ul>
</ul>
