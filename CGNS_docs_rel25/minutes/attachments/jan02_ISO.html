Status of the ISO-STEP Initiative for CGNS-Based Fluid Dynamics Standard
</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>
Establish an ISO-STEP standard for representation, storage, and exchange
of digital data in fluid dynamics.

<h2>What Is STEP?</h2>

<ul>
<li> STEP is an acronym
     <ul>
     <li> <u>ST</u>andard for the <u>E</u>xchange of <u>P</u>roduct model data
     </ul>
<li> Formal name is ISO 10303
     <ul>
     <li> Industrial automation systems and integration
     <li> Product data representation and exchange
     <li> Intended (eventually) to cover the complete life cycle of all
          industrial products
     </ul>
<li> PDES is Product Data Exchange using STEP
     <ul>
     <li> PDES is the U.S. effort, administered through the IGES/PDES
          organization, to support the development and deployment of the
          international STEP standard
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Strategy</h2>

<ul>
<li> Adapt CGNS as the kernel of an ISO standard for storage and
     exchange of digital data in fluid dynamics
     <ul>
     <li> Utilize current CGNS structure and concepts to the maximum extent
          that is practical
     <li> Use current CGNS user base as core supporters for the ISO Fluid
          Dynamics AP development
     </ul>
<li> Utilize a two-stage strategy
     <ul>
     <li> First: Establish an AP for CFD data
          <ul>
          <li> Build on existing CGNS, which is fairly mature for CFD
          </ul>
     <li> Second: Extend the AP to other types of fluid dynamics data
          <ul>
          <li> Wind tunnel, flight test, hydrodynamics, etc.
          </ul>
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Differences between ISO-STEP and CGNS</h2>

<p>
ISO-STEP is based on ...

<ul>
<li> Strong link to Product Data Management 
     <ul>
     <li> Record of all data sources, persistent links if possible
     </ul>
<li> Commonality and re-use of existing data structures to maximum      
     extent possible                                                         
     <ul>
     <li> E.g., re-use data structures from AP203 (geometry), AP209
          (finite element analysis), and AP232 (technical data exchange)
     <li> As we create new data structures, attempt to anticipate future
          use of those data structures by other disciplines
     </ul>
<li> ASCII data exchange 
     <ul>
     <li> We will need to extend ISO-STEP to provide binary data
          exchange as an option                                         
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>ISO Organization</h2>

     alt="Chart showing ISO heirarchy related to CGNS"
     longdesc="jan02_ISO/fig1.html">

<h2>Operating Relationships</h2>

<ul>
<li> ISO Standards Organization
     <ul>
     <li> Integrate the fluid dynamics standard requirements with other
          ISO standards
     </ul>
<li> Fluid Dynamics Standards Initiative
     <ul>
     <li> Map the CGNS content into the ISO process
     <li> Build international support

     </ul>
<li> CGNS Steering Committee (AIAA)
     <ul>
     <li> Intellectual content of the CGNS standard (SIDS)
     <li> ADF libraries
     <li> Mid-level libraries
     </ul>
</ul>

<p>
We will work with on the existing CGNS Steering Committee, and the
users they represent, to build international consensus for the proposed
standard.

<h2>Recent Events</h2>

<p>
Since previous committee meeting, June 2001:

<ul>
<li> Extensive rewrite of all four parts (completed Aug-Sept 2001)
<li> Page-by-page review at ISO SC4 meeting (Fukuoka, Japan, 1-5 October
     2001)
<li> Now incorporating all pending comments
     <ul>
     <li> To be completed early February 2002
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Future Events</h2>

<ul>
<li> ISO SC4 Meeting - Myrtle Beach, SC; February 25 - March 1, 2002
     <ul>
     <li> Hope to release Part 52 to Committee Draft ballot
          <ul>
          <li> First public release of a complete draft standard
          <li> This initiates the formal process of responding to all
               comments for Part 52
          </ul>
     <li> Page-by-page review of all four parts
     </ul>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>
Is there any interest in holding a workshop with members from
this Committee for a detailed review of AP 237 and the
derivative parts?
<ul>
<li> At least two days
<li> Participants - CGNS Steering Committee and representatives of the
     AP 237 project
<li> Spring 2002
<li> Somewhere in the US
     <ul>
