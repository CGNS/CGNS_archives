<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Telecon Minutes</h2>

18 September 2003<br>
11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time<br><br>

<ol>
<li> The meeting was called to order at 11:05 AM, at the start of the
     east-coast hurricane Isabel.
     There were <a href="#attendees">14 attendees</a>, listed below.
<br><br>
<li> The minutes of the <a href="telecon_may03.html">29 May 2003
     telecon meeting</a> were reviewed and approved as posted on the web
     site.
<br><br>
<li> Status of previous action items:<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> HDF-5 implementation (Power):
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> AEDC has implemented the ADFH library (HDF5) for
               CGNS files, and tested it successfully with Wind and
               ADFViewer.  Seems about 20% slower than ADF for large
               datasets.  Have not done much investigation into why it
               is slower.
          <li> Greg Power asked for advice on licensing/release
               issues.  For government organizations like AEDC, what
               are the difficulties, procedures to follow, etc., in
               re-distributing modified open-source (e.g., GNU licensed)
               software?  No one had an answer to this.  <u>Power will try
               to obtain permission to release their work to the CGNS
               steering committee as soon as possible.</u>
          <li> Others confirmed that the use of CGNS for large databases
               can be prohibitively slow.  The problem appears to be
               related to the number of nodes (quadratic dependence),
               not so much to the amount of data stored in each node.
               Reading seems to be faster than writing.  Timing tests
               seem to indicate the bottleneck is in
               <a href="../midlevel/open.html"><tt>cg_close</tt></a>.
               <u>Wedan will look into this high priority issue.</u>
          <li> Need to establish communication between Power and Poinot
               on their experience with the HDF5 software, if possible.
          <li> Still no linking capability.  Is this a fundamental
               problem with HDF5?  <u>Power will check into this.</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Review of 2 proposals
          for extension
          (Bush):
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Discussion tabled because Bob had to sign off telecon
               early.  <u>Action item carries over.</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Comments added to website on release policy (Wedan):
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Added to
               <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgns/">SourceForge
               web site</a> <img src="../external.png" alt="external link">,
               but limited to 256 characters
          <li> Alonso offered to house CGNS website at Stanford, if
               needed
          <li> <u>Wedan will look into adding a "home page" at SourceForge,
               allowing more content.</u>
          </ul>
     <li> <a href="../filemap/nodes.html#CGNSLibraryVersion"><tt>CGNSLibraryVersion</tt></a>
          now mandatory, documentation in place; no <tt>CGNSVersion</tt>
          extension is being proposed (Towne):
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Towne confirmed that the documentation has been updated.
          </ul>
     <li> Latest 2.2 docs to AIAA for update to
          <a href="../aiaa.html">Recommended Practice</a> (Towne):
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> PDF file, in style used for AIAA Recommended Practice,
               was sent to AIAA on Sept. 2, but no response from them
               as yet.
          </ul>
     <li> Issue of removed element list and element range (Wedan):
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> These are easy to re-implement (and in fact the software
               changes have already been made and tested in the CVS version).
          <li> <u>Wedan will write and post an extension proposal, to make
               it official.</u>
          </ul>
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Charter issues (Rumsey): <u>Rumsey and Edwards will work together
     to update the <a href="../charter/index.html">Charter</a>.</u>
<br><br>
<li> ISO Status - Chris described the current status, based on info in
     an email from Ray Cosner.
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Still no Boeing funds for this work.  It even seems doubtful
          that they will be able to restore funding in 2004.
     <li> ISO has adopted a new rule, requiring the cancellation of any
          initiatives that have not shown any progress (i.e., passing a
          gate) in two years.  Under the new rule, all four parts of the
          CGNS initiative are subject to cancellation on Sep 30, 2003.
     <li> Ray and Peter Wilson put together and submitted to ISO a draft
          submittal for Parts 52, 53, and 110 for gate 3.  Hopefully these
          will be accepted, and keep the effort alive for two more years.
     <li> They also created a draft of Part 237 for gate 2, although
          this has some missing pieces.
     <li> <u>Wedan will be posting the
          new drafts at the
          CGNS web site.</u>
     </ol>
<br>
<li> HDF5 status (Poinot): On a note unrelated to HDF5, Chris reported
     that Marc had been working on a MY-SQL DBS server for CGNS files
     over the summer.
<br><br>
<li> Documentation issues and
     CGNStalk issues (Towne):
     <ol type="a">
     <li> No documentation issues.
     <li> CGNStalk has received several emails containing viruses within
          the last few weeks.  Usually, but not always, the attachment
          containing the virus is removed by mail filters at NASA Glenn
          before being sent to the list.  So far, this has been more of a
          nuisance than a severe problem, and no changes have been made to
          the subscription policy for CGNStalk.
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Software status (Wedan):
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Most of the recent work has been on the configuration scripts
          and the include files, to make the software more portable.  It
          works for Macintosh, also.
     <li> A new release has not been made yet.  Users need to do a CVS
          update to get the latest updated software.
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Discussion on extensions:  
     <ol type="a">
     <li> The deadline for commenting on the
          extension proposals currently posted
          has passed.  However, we need information/review
          from Bush on their status before proceeding.
     <li> Need for decision regarding allowing
          <a href="../sids/build.html#GridLocation"><tt>GridLocation=FaceCenter</tt></a>
          for <a href="../sids/cnct.html#GridConnectivity"><tt>GridConnectivity</tt></a>
          (assign team to create a proposal? user who identified need:
          Harlan McMorris, CentaurSoft). <u>Rumsey will look into this.</u>
     <li> Need for allowing
          <a href="../sids/bc.html#BCDataSet"><tt>BCDataSet</tt></a> under
          <a href="../sids/misc.html#Family"><tt>Family_t</tt></a>
          node? (assign team to create a proposal? User who identified
          need:  Edwin van der Weide, Stanford). <u>Van der Weide
          will write up a formal proposal, and submit it to Bruce for
          posting.</u>
     <li> It was mentioned that it would be nice to allow
          <a href="../sids/cnct.html#GridConnectivityProperty">Periodic BC
          property</a> under a
          <a href="../sids/cnct.html#GridConnectivity1to1"><tt>GridConnectivity1to1</tt></a>
          node, in addition to under the general
          <a href="../sids/cnct.html#GridConnectivity"><tt>GridConnectivity</tt></a>
          node. <u>Van der Weide will write a proposal, and submit to
          Bruce for posting.</u>
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Other issues - Reno abstract on CGNS was not accepted.  However,
     Theresa Benyo reported that Poinot will be an invited member
     of a panel discussion at Reno (Integrated Computational and
     Visualization Environments, 8am-12noon Wed Jan 7), but there would
     be no published paper. <u>Poinot (Rumsey, Bush) will also re-submit
     the abstract to the Portland AIAA meeting.</u>
<br><br>
<li> Meeting was adjourned at 12:00 PM.
<br><br>
<li> Summary of action items:
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Power will try to obtain permission to release their work to
          the CGNS steering committee as soon as possible.
     <li> Wedan will look into the high priority issue of why CGNS is so
          slow for large numbers of nodes.
     <li> Power will check into whether linking is a fundamental problem
          for HDF5.
     <li> Bush to review/report on the 2 pending proposals for
          extension.
     <li> Wedan will look into adding a "home page" at SourceForge,
          allowing more content &amp; description of CVS and release process.
     <li> Wedan will write and post an extension proposal, regarding
          issue of removed element list and element range.
     <li> Rumsey and Edwards will work together to update the Charter.
     <li> Wedan will post the new ISO drafts at the CGNS web site.
     <li> Rumsey will look into need for allowing
          <tt>GridLocation=FaceCenter</tt> for <tt>GridConnectivity</tt>.
     <li> Van der Weide will write up two formal proposals: one
          for allowing <tt>BCDataSet</tt> under <tt>Family_t</tt>
          node, and one for allowing Periodic BC property under a
          <tt>GridConnectivity1to1</tt> node.  Wedan will post these.
     <li> Poinot (Rumsey, Bush) will re-submit the abstract for the
          Portland AIAA meeting.
