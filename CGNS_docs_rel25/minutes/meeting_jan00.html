<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Meeting Minutes</h2>

10 January 2000<br>
6:30pm<br>
Reno, Nevada

<p>
The meeting was called to order at 6:30pm by Bob Bush.
There were 21 attendees, representing 16 organizations,
<a href="#attendees">listed below</a>.

<p>
The minutes of the December telecon were approved.

<ul>
<li> Final copies of the Steering Committee Charter were distributed.
     The charter is also available on the CGNS web site.
<br><br>
<li> Discussion of proposed changes to the Steering Committee.
     <br><br>
     <ul>
     <li> Bob Bush introduced Steve Legensky of Intelligent Light,
          and reviewed the request to add Intelligent Light to the
          Steering Committee. Steve Legensky reviewed what Intelligent
          Light brings to the Committee. This includes a commitment to
          implement CGNS in their product, bring a significant customer
          base and therefore provide user feedback. Intelligent Light
          also offered to bring technology elements based on previous
          contracted work which may significantly speed CGNS data
          access, and committed a one person level of effort in support
          of the CGNS standard, upgrades and utilities.
     <br><br>
     <li> Diane Poirier introduced Nouredine Hakimi and Marc Tombroff of
          NUMECA and reviewed their request that NUMECA becomes a member
          of the CGNS Steering Committee. The NUMECA representatives
          relayed their experiences implementing CGNS into their
          production capability and their extensive European contact,
          customer base and international collaborations.
     <br><br>
     <li> The committee agreed to add Intelligent Light and NUMECA to
          the Steering Committee by unanimous consent.
     <br><br>
     <li> With these additions the Steering Committee is composed of 14
          organizations (up to 15 are allowed by the Charter).
     <br><br>
     <li> There was some discussion of who the appropriate Air Force
          representative should be. It used to be Steve Scherr of AFRL
          in Dayton, but he has a new position and may no longer be the
          appropriate point of contact. It was noted that there is other
          potential AF organizations that might be more active in the
          Committee. No actions were taken at this time.
     </ul>
<br>
<li> Theresa Babrauckas displayed several versions of the 'swan' logo
     for comment and discussion.  After some discussion, she agreed
     to go back to refine and select a small number of candidates for
     further review. Ed Hall also indicated a willingness to look at
     meshing and solving 'on' the logo to obtain color contours as a
     potential logo.
<br><br>
<li> Bob Bush reviewed the <a href="#aiaa">material to be proposed at
     the AIAA CFD Committee on Standards</a> the following evening. The
     Committee had a final agreement that we would propose becoming a
     sub-committee of that AIAA committee, establishing an affiliation
     between the CGNS Steering Committee and the AIAA. The proposal
     materials are included as attachments. (Bob Bush made the
     presentation the following evening. After a question and answer
     period, and some discussion, the AIAA CFD Committee on Standards
     approved the proposal. Thus, the CGNS Steering Committee is now
     formally affiliated with the AIAA CFD Committee on Standards as the
     CGNS Sub-Committee.)
<br><br>
<li> Diane Poirier reviewed the current status of the CGNS software and
     proposed extensions.  There was some discussion about the Chemistry
     proposal, and the potential need for a more complete definition,
     and/or a phased implementation of capabilities. Theresa Babrauckas
     indicated that we should contact the NCC group on their experiences
     and requirements for chemistry data for aerodynamic modeling, and
     agreed to make contact with them to get their input. It was also
     recommended that we look at the CHEMKIN database as it is widely
     used to define chemistry properties, and the chemistry support in
     KIVA. Mori Mani agreed to review the CGNS extension proposal and
     make specific recommendations.
<br><br>
<li> Diane Poirier reviewed the CGNS evaluation report from
     Aerospatiale. Their conclusion is that CGNS could replace their
     current file format (DAMAS) once the I/O performance is improved.
<br><br>
<li> There was a brief discussion of the current status of the ISO
     standard process as it relates to CGNS.
<br><br>
<li> There was a brief discussion on potential future funding sources to
     support the CGNS standard.  A draft <a href="#funding">Funding
     Requirements document</a> is attached for comment.
</ul>

<p>
The meeting was adjourned at 8:15.

<h2>Position Paper - AIAA Committee on Standards</h2>

<p>
The CGNS Steering Committee has been established to help ensure the
continuation of the CFD General Notation System (CGNS). In order to
perform this mission most effectively, the Steering Committee would
like to affiliate with an established organization that can support
the mission of the Committee, and help ensure the establishment and
continuation of the Standard.

<p>
The CGNS Steering Committee has become aware of the AIAA CFD Committee
on Standards, and would like to explore the possibility of becoming
a sub-committee of that organization. This affiliation will advance
the AIAA mission and the CFD CoS mission to promote the acceptance of
standards in a core area if interest to AIAA.

<p>
This document summarizes the expectations and anticipated working
relationship that the CGNS Steering Committee would like to see
materialize.

<p>
The AIAA Committee on Standards would create a new sub-committee, called
the CGNS sub-committee, which would be the continuation of the existing
CGNS Steering Committee.

<p>
The CGNS sub-committee would operate autonomously, and would not
increase the workload on existing sub-committees.

<p>
A member of the CGNS sub-committee (usually the CGNS Steering Committee
Chairperson) would represent the sub-committee at AIAA Committee on
Standards meetings.

<p>
This affiliation does not preclude the CGNS Steering Committee from
collaborating with other professional organizations that might also
support the continuation of the CGNS Data Standard.

<p>
Access to AIAA communications media, technical conferences, committees,
etc. will accelerate the process of gaining acceptance for CGNS
and ensuring that CGNS meets the needs of the entire aerospace CFD
community.

<p>
The AIAA would support the CGNS sub-committee by providing a legal
entity through which contracts could be negotiated, and funding
accumulated and distributed in support of the Standard.  (The
sub-committee is responsible for raising any funds that are to be
disbursed by them.)

<p>
The CGNS sub-committee would abide by the CGNS Steering Committee
Charter (until such time as the CoS adopts their own by-laws).

<a name="funding"></a>
<h2>Funding Requirements</h2>

<p>
The CGNS Steering Committee has been established to help ensure the
continuation of the CFD General Notation System (CGNS). In order to
perform this mission, resources will be required to maintain and further
develop the software and documentation, to help propagate the standard,
and to ensure a sufficient support to new adepts of CGNS. This document
outlines the effort the Steering Committee feels is required to maintain
a viable data standard for CFD.

<h3>Proposed Tasks</h3>

<p>
The effort has been broken down into the ten categories summarized in
the following table. An estimate in man-year of the level of effort
required in each given year is also shown. A brief description of the

<h3>Description of the specific tasks</h3>

<h4>1. Extensions</h4>

<p>
The more CGNS is being adopted, the more the users request extensions to
the standard to support data types not yet part of the SIDS. The CGNS
Steering Committee recognizes that it is not possible to satisfy every
individual requirement. However, some requests are general enough to
benefit the whole CFD community.

<p>
The role of the CGNS Committee would then be to determine which
extensions are general enough to be added to the CGNS standard. It would
supervise the elaboration of proposals by voluntary sub-committees and
post these proposals on the CGNS web site for all users to comment on
them.  Once approved by the CGNS Steering Committee, these proposals
would be implemented in the documentation and software (API).

<h4>2. Validation and Performance Reports</h4>

<h5>2.1 Validation</h5>

<p>
As the CGNS API extends, and if more and more programmers add their
contributions to it, the risk to introduce bugs increases. In addition,
the more the user base grows, the more costly problems in the software
will be. It is therefore important to establish a test metric that will
grow with the API.  This test metric should allow testing every function
of the API and every node in the CGNS ADF tree. It should also allow
testing both the C and FORTRAN interfaces on all supported platforms.

<h5>2.2 Verification</h5>

<p>
Users are questioning the performance of CGNS, and what they can expect
in comparison to their existing I/O systems. Preliminary performance
tests have shown that it takes more CPU time to create a new CGNS file,
or to read an existing one, then to write or read a typical sequencial
file.  However, once the database is created, interrogating a CGNS file
shows much better performance.  This is due to the fact that CGNS not
only writes long list of data, but also creates an organized database.

<p>
The penalty involved with the initial creation of the hierarchical
database worries several users. In order to provide potential users
with the confidence required to rely on the new standard, a thoroughly
performance study on the CGNS I/O should be conducted. Parameters
such as operating system, number of blocks and nodes in the mesh,
unstructured or structured data, quantity of auxiliary information, etc,
should be included in this performance study. The performance of the
CGNS I/O in CPU time, wall clock time and memory, should be compared
with other I/O systems (FORTRAN read/write, C fread/fwrite, Plot3D,
etc... ).

<h4>3. Documentation</h4>

<p>
The CGNS Data Standard (SIDS), and associated software (ADF and API),
currently have a substantial body of documentation. This documentation
will need to be enhanced, maintained and augmented, as extensions are
approved and implemented. The existing documentation, although necessary
and useful, is enough to scare away the most devoted CGNS fan... Since
one of the main goals of the CGNS Steering committee is to propagate the
standard by acquiring more and more users, it is necessary to provide
for simpler and more comprehensive documentation, in the form of a
User's Guide and Training Manual.

<h4>4. Training</h4>

<p>
It is envisioned that as CGNS is accepted and adopted by various
software organizations, that training will be required to facilitate new
users. This effort will develop training materials, and provide training
for new users. The aim is to reduce the barriers to full implementation,
and to gain wide acceptance of the standard.

<h4>5. Web Maintenance</h4>

<p>
The CGNS web site was originally established as a mean to distribute the
CGNS software and documentation. It has grown to be a key element in the
propagation of the CGNS standard. In addition to its primary function of
distribution, the CGNS web site also allows to recruit new users.  It
informs users of any pertinent CGNS news and receives user questions
and requests. It is also used to post new proposals for extensions to
the standard, and any other relevant documentation such as conference
papers, presentation viewgraphs, etc. Finally it provides for a "meeting
place" for all CGNS users. It can be foreseen that eventually a CGNS
News Group could be added to the web site to facilitate exchange between
users.

<h4>6. User Support</h4>

<p>
As the user base grows, the number of questions and requests send to
the CGNS-Support Team increases accordingly. Timely response to users
requests is mandatory in order to maintain users interest. So in the
coming years, users support should be a priority.  When the user base is
large enough, we foresee that a News Group may be sufficient, as users
could answer each other questions.

<h4>7. Utility Development</h4>

<p>
Utilities differ from extensions for they do not change the Standard
Interface Data Structures (SIDS). They are instead tools facilitating
the use of CGNS. For examples, it would be useful to have a utility to
compare two CGNS files, or to view the file content graphically. Several
proposals for utility development have been submitted to the CGNS
Steering Committee. The Steering Committee supports the idea of creating
some utilities that would benefit all users.

<h4>8. Platform/OS Upgrade, Maintenance &amp; Validation</h4>

<p>
The CGNS API and ADF Core are distributed on most platforms/operating
systems commonly used by the CFD community. Currently, these are
SGI/IRIX, SUN/Solaris, HP/UX, IBM/AIX, DEC-Alpha/OSF, CRAY/Unicos and
WindowsNT. Although not distributed on the CGNS web site, users have
also compiled and ran CGNS successfully on Linux. It is important
to continue porting CGNS to a wide range of platforms, and keep
updating the compiled libraries as the different operating systems are
upgraded. This automatically involves testing the API on all new or
upgraded operating system.

<h4>9. Outreach</h4>

<p>
In the early years of CGNS, the outreach effort is crucial in order to
inform the CFD community of the existence of CGNS, and convince key
organizations to adopt the CGNS standard, and maybe even contribute to
its development.

<h4>10. Administration</h4>

<p>
Most administrative efforts are done on a voluntary basis. However
some extraordinary administrative costs may arise. For example, the
cost related to the user meeting at the Reno conference, or the cost
of teleconferences between Steering Committee members. The Steering
Committee should be able to cover for such special administrative costs.

<h3>Funding Sources</h3>

<p>
Much of the work, to date and anticipated, will be performed as in-kind
contributions from CGNS Steering Committee Members and CGNS users at
large.

<p>
Additional resources will be sought to reimburse the software Focal
Point for work performed to maintain the software.

<p>
Interested parties may seek resources to fund significant extensions to
the standard or software utilities.

<p>
Funding/contributions will be sought from industry and government
agencies interested in extending and maintaining the CGNS
Standard. Support may be provided:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> to the CGNS Steering Committee who will contract with interested
     parties and,
<li> directly to parties interested in working on the CGNS Standard. (It
     is anticipated that these activities will be coordinated with the
     Steering Committee.)
