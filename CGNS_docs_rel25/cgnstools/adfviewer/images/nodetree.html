<p>
This is an image of a typical Node Tree from the ADFviewer main window.
At the top is the root node of the ADF file, named simply "/", and shown
with a folder icon.
The next line is the "CGNSLibraryVersion" node, marked with a file icon.

<p>
Next is the base node for the CGNS database, named "Basename" and marked
with a folder icon.
The left is a "-" sign, indicating that the Basename node has been
expanded, and clicking the "-" sign will collapse it.

<p>
Below the Basename node are two zone nodes, named "zone#1" and "zone#2",
both marked with folder icons, and both expanded.

<p>
Below the "zone#1" node are the following seven nodes.
<ul>
<li> "Zone#1 sol#1", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "Zone#1 sol#2", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "ZoneGridConnectivity", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "ZoneBC", marked with a folder icon, and expanded.
     Below this is the node "boco#1", marked with a folder icon,
     and expanded.
     Below the "boco#1" node is a node named "DataSetName", marked
     with a folder icon, and collapsed, and three nodes named
     "PointRange", "InwardNormalIndex", and "InwardNormalList", all
     marked with file icons
<li> "discrete#1", marked with a folder icon, and expanded.
     Below this is the node "arrayname", marked with a folder icon,
     and expanded.
     Below "arrayname" is a node named "DimensionalUnits", marked
     with a file icon.
<li> "ZoneType", marked with a linked file icon.
<li> "GridCoordinates", marked with a linked folder icon, and expanded.
     Below this are nodes named "CoordinateY", "CoordinateZ", and
     "CoordinateX", all marked with Folder icons and with their names
     in blue, since they're children of the linked node "GridCoordinates".
</ul>

<p>
Below the "zone#2" node are nodes named ZoneType, marked with a file
icon, and "GridCoordinates",  marked with a folder icon, and expanded.
Below "GridCoordinates", the node "CoordinateX" is visible, marked with
a file icon.
There are additional nodes below "zone#2", as indicated by the length
of the vertical scroll bar, but they're not visible in this example.
