The Defaults Setup window has the title "Defaults", and is divided
into four sections.

<p>
The first section, at the top, is titled "Volume Mesh".
On the left is a check box labeled "Visible as", and to the right of
this are four radio buttons labeled "Outline", "Mesh", "Flat", and
"Smooth".
The "Visible as" box is checked, and the "Outline" button is selected.

<p>
Below this is a section titled "Regions", with the same check box
and radio buttons as the "Volume Mesh" section.
In the "Regions" section, the "Visible as" box is unchecked, and the
"Mesh" button is selected.

<p>
The third section is at the lower left, and is titled "Colors".
It consists of eight "Select" buttons, organized vertically, labeled
"Background" and "Color 1" through "Color 7".
In order, the "Select" buttons are colored black, gray, red, yellow,
green, cyan, blue, and magenta.

<p>
The fourth section, at the lower right, has five buttons, labeled
"Defaults", "Add", "Remove", "Accept", and "Cancel".
