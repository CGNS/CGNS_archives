This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the
specification of solution data when a rind plane is present.
It shows the same node tree as was used for the 
<a href="fig21.html">illustrating the specification of a location for
solution data</a>, but with the addition of a node named "Rind" below
the Cylinder Solution node.

<p>
In the node tree the Density node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Example/Cylinder/Cylinder Solution", the node name is Density, and the
node label is DataArray_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is R4, the dimensions
values are now 5, 9, 5, and the bytes value is 900.
The density values are shown in the node data panel.
