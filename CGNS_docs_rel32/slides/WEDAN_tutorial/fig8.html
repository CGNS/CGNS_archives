This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the use of
nodes documenting the equation set and numerical model.
It shows the same node tree as described in previous figures, but with
the addition of nodes named "SimulationType" and "FlowEquationSet" below
the Example node (the base node for the CGNS database).

<p>
The SimulationType node is marked with a file icon, and the
FlowEquationSet node is marked with a folder icon, and expanded.
Below the FlowEquationSet node are nodes named "EquationDimension",
"GoverningEquations", and "GasModel", each marked with a file icon.

<p>
In the node tree the GoverningEquations node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Example/FlowEquationSet", the node name is GoverningEquations,
and the node label is GoverningEquations_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is C1, the dimensions
value is 5, and the bytes value is 5.
The string "Euler" is shown in the node data panel.
