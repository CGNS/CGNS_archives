This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the
specification of conditions at a boundary surface.
It shows the same node tree as described for
<a href="fig15.html">specification of an inlet boundary surface</a>,
except that below the
Inlet node is an additional node named "Inflow Conditions", marked
with a folder icon and expanded.

<p>
Below the Inflow Conditions node is a node named "DirichletData",
also marked with a folder icon and expanded.
Below the DirichletData node are nodes named "Density", "VelocityX",
"VelocityY", and "VelocityZ", each marked with a file icon.

<p>
In the node tree the Inflow Conditions node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Example/Cube/ZoneBC/Inlet", the node name is Inflow Conditions,
and the node label is BCDataSet_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is C1, the dimensions
value is 16, and the bytes value is 16.
The string "BCInflowSubsonic" is shown in the node data panel.
