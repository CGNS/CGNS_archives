<p>
This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the structure
of both grid coordinates and flow solution data in a CGNS file for two
zones.
It shows the same node tree as described previously
<a href="fig3.html">illustrating the storage of flow solution data</a>,
but with the addition of a second zone node, and with all the nodes
expanded.

<p>
There are now two zone nodes below the Example node, named "Cube" and
"Cylinder".
Below each of these is a grid coordinates node named "GridCoordinates",
and below each GridCoordinates node are nodes named "CoordinateX",
"CoordinateY", and "CoordinateZ".
Also below each zone node is a flow solution node, named "Cube Solution"
below the Cube node, and "Cylinder Solution" below the Cylinder node.
Below each of the flow solution nodes are nodes named "Density",
"MomentumX", "MomentumY", "MomentumZ", and "EnergyStagnationDensity".

<p>
In the node tree the CGNSLibraryVersion node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/", the node name is CGNSLibraryVersion, and the node label is
CGNSLibraryVersion_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is R4, the dimensions
value is 1, and the bytes value is 4.
The version number 2.42 is shown in the node data panel.
