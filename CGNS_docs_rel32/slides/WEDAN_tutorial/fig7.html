This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the use of a
node documenting the reference state.
It shows the same node tree as described in previous figures, but with
the addition of a node named "ReferenceState" below the Example node
(the base node for the CGNS database).
The ReferenceState node is marked with a folder icon, and expanded.

<p>
Below the ReferenceState node are the following nodes, with the names
indicated.
<ul>
<li> "ReferenceStateDescription", marked with a file icon
<li> "Mach", marked with a folder icon, and expanded
<li> "SpecificHeatRatio", marked with a folder icon, and expanded
<li> "LengthReference", marked with a folder icon, and expanded
</ul>

<p>
Below each of the Mach, SpecificHeatRatio, and LengthReference nodes is
a DataClass node, marked with a file icon.
Also below the LengthReference node is a DimensionalUnits node, also
marked with a file icon.

<p>
In the node tree the ReferenceStateDescription node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Example/ReferenceState", the node name is ReferenceStateDescription,
and the node label is Descriptor_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is C1, the dimensions
value is 20, and the bytes value is 20.
The string "Reference Quantities" is shown in the node data panel.
