This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the use of
cylindrical coordinates instead of Cartesion coordinates.
It shows the same node tree as described in previous figures, but with
cylindrical coordinates used in the Cylinder zone.

<p>
Below the Cylinder node, the GridCoordinates node is expanded, and below
it are nodes named "CoordinateR", "CoordinateTheta", and "CoordinateZ",
each marked with a file icon.

<p>
In the node tree the GridCoordinates node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Example/Cylinder", the node name is GridCoordinates,
and the node label is GridCoordinates_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is MT, the dimensions
value is null, and the bytes value is 0.
No data are shown in the node data panel.
