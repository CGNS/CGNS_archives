<p>
As an example of the use of Python and pyCGNS, suppose you needed to
use a structured-grid CGNS file with an application that required an
unstructured grid.
This diagram illustrates how this could be done.

<p>
On the right is an end-user Python script.
It would use pyCGNS to read the structured-grid CGNS file, and create an
in-memory unstructured version of it as a Python/CGNS tree.
The application code would then use the in-memory unstructured tree.
