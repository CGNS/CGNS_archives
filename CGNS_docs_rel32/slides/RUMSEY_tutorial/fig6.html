This is an image of the ADFviewer main window illustrating the storage
of boundary condition information in a CGNS file.
It shows the same node tree as described earlier for a
<a href="fig2.html">typical view of a CGNS file</a>, but with the Zone 1
node expanded.

<p>
Below the Zone 1 node are the following nodes.
<ul>
<li> "ZoneType", marked with a file icon
<li> "ZoneBC", marked with a folder icon, and expanded.
<li> "ZoneGridConnectivity", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "GridCoordinates", marked with a linked folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "CFL3DBoundaryValues", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "FlowSolution", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "ZoneIterativeData", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
<li> "FlowEquationSel", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed
</ul>

<p>
Below the ZoneBC node are the following nodes.
<ul>
<li> "Ilo_Seg 1", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed.
<li> "Ihi_Seg 1", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed.
<li> "Jlo_Seg 1", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed.
<li> "Jhi_Seg 1", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed.
<li> "Klo_Seg 1", marked with a folder icon, and expanded.
<li> "Khi_Seg 1", marked with a folder icon, and collapsed.
</ul>

<p>
Below the Klo_Seg 1 node are the following nodes.
<ul>
<li> "PrintRange", marked with a file icon
<li> "CFL3DType", marked with a file icon
<li> "CFL3DAuxData", marked with a file icon
</ul>

<p>
In the node tree the Klo_Seg 1 node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Base/Zone 1/ZoneBC", the node name is Klo_Seg 1, and the node label is
BC_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is C1, the dimensions
value is 21, and the bytes value is 21.
The string BCWallViscousHeatFlux is shown in the node data panel.
