<h2>Introduction</h2>

<ul>
<li> CGNS provides a general, portable, and extensible standard for the
     storage and retrieval of CFD analysis data
<li> Principal target is data normally associated with computed
     solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations &amp; its derivatives
<li> But applicable to computational field physics in general (with
     augmentation of data definitions and storage conventions)
</ul>

<h2>What is CGNS?</h2>

<ul>
<li> Standard for defining &amp; storing CFD data
     <ul>
     <li> Self-descriptive
     <li> Machine-independent
     <li> Very general and extendable
     <li> Administered by international steering committee
     </ul>
<li> AIAA recommended practice (AIAA R-101-2002)
<li> In process of becoming part of international ISO standard
<li> Free and open software
<li> Well-documented
<li> Discussion forum: cgnstalk@lists.nasa.gov
<li> Website: http://www.cgns.org
</ul>

<h2>History</h2>

<ul>
<li> CGNS was started in the mid-1990s as a joint effort between NASA,
     Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas
     <ul>
     <li> Under NASA's Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) program
     </ul>
<li> Arose from need for common CFD data format for improved
     collaborative analyses between multiple organizations
     <ul>
     <li> Existing formats, such as PLOT3D, were incomplete, cumbersome
          to share between different platforms, and not self-descriptive
          (poor for archival purposes)
     </ul>
<li> Initial development was heavily influenced by McDonnell Douglas'
     "Common File Format", which had been in use since 1989
<li> Version 1.0 of CGNS released in May 1998
<li> After AST funding ended in 1999, CGNS steering committee was formed
     <ul>
     <li> Voluntary public forum
     <li> International members from government, industry, academia
     <li> Formally became a sub-committee of AIAA Committee on Standards
          in 2000
     </ul>
<li> Initial efforts by Boeing to make CGNS an international ISO-STEP
     standard (1999-2002)
     <ul>
     <li> Stalled due to lack of funding
     <li> Instead, the existing ISO standard AP209 (finite element solid
          mechanics) is being rewritten (AP209E2) to include CGNS as
          well as an integrated engineering analysis framework (headed
          by Lockheed-Martin)
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Steering committee</h2>

<ul>
<li> CGNS Steering committee is a public forum
<li> Responsibilities include (1) maintaining software, documentation,
     and website, (2) ensuring free distribution, and (3) promoting
     acceptance
<li> Current steering committee make-up (20 members):
     <ul>
     <li> ADAPCO
     <li> ANSYS-CFX
     <li> Aerospatiale Matra Airbus
     <li> Boeing - IDS/PW
     <li> Boeing Commercial
     <li> Boeing IDS
     <li> Fluent
     <li> ANSYS-ICEM
     <li> Intelligent Light
     <li> NASA Glenn
     <li> NASA Langley
     <li> ONERA
     <li> Pacific NW Laboratory
     <li> Pointwise
     <li> Pratt &amp; Whitney
     <li> Pratt &amp; Whitney - Rocketdyne
     <li> Rolls-Royce Allison
     <li> Stanford University
     <li> U.S. Air Force / AEDC
     <li> Utah State University
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>CGNS main features</h2>

<ul>
<li> Hierarchical data structure: quickly traversed and sorted, no need
     to process irrelevant data
<li> Files stored in compact C binary format
<li> Layered so that many of the data structures are optional
<li> ADF or HDF5 database: universal and self-describing
<li> Data may encompass multiple files through the use of links
<li> Portable ANSI C software, with complete Fortran and C interfaces
<li> Architecture-independent application programming interface (API) -
     written as a mid-level library (MLL)
</ul>

<h2>CGNS File Layout</h2>

<h2>Makeup of CGNS</h2>

<ul>
<li> Standard Interface Data Structures (SIDS) is the core of CGNS -
     defines the intellectual content
     <ul>
     <li> Defines what goes in the "boxes" and how they are organized
     </ul>
<li> Original low level implementation is Advanced Data Format (ADF)
     <ul>
     <li> Basic direct I/O operations
     <li> Software has no knowledge of data structure or contents
     <li> Tree-based (nodal parent/child) structure
     </ul>
<li> Low level implementation is migrating toward HDF5 format
     <ul>
     <li> HDF5 is already available as an option
     <li> HDF5 is well-supported (NCSA), widely used, and has parallel
          I/O capability
     <li> This will be the official recommended format, although ADF
          will also continue to be supported, and MLL will translate
          between the two
     </ul>
<li> Mid-level library (MLL) is currently available for C and Fortran
     <ul>
     <li> This is what most users employ
     <li> Software has some knowledge of SIDS
     <li> C++ and Python extensions also available 
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>How CGNS works</h2>

<ul>
<li> Users must download the CGNS software
     <ul>
     <li> This includes ADF software (basic I/O operations in binary
          format)
     <li> Also includes MLL software (for ease of implementation)
     <li> Users wishing to use HDF5 instead of ADF must download this
          separately (MLL will work with either ADF or HDF5)
     </ul>
<li> Users are encouraged to use the MLL to read and write their data
     (helps ensure CGNS-compatibility)
<li> Files are portable across computer platforms
<li> Tools (such as adfviewer) allow user to "see" what is in the CGNS
     file
<li> Many commercial pre- and post-processing software support CGNS
     format
</ul>

<h2>Cons and Pros</h2>

<ul>
<li> Cons
     <ul>
     <li> Although there are rules, there are also many options and a
          certain amount of freedom
          <ul>
          <li> Example: GridLocation = Vertex vs. CellCenter
          <li> Example: data can be stored dimensional or nondimensional
          <li> Example: optional use of Rind cells
          </ul>
     <li> This flexibility places more responsibility on the CGNS reader
          to figure out how to make use of what is in the file
     <li> Attempted balance between too rigid and too flexible
     </ul>
<li> Pros
     <ul>
     <li> As more people use it, more tools get developed to handle the
          flexibility
     <li> Can be as simple as storing only "grid + flow solution", or as
          complex as storing <em>everything</em> needed to run/describe
          a case
     <li> Longevity and infinite extensibility
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>How CGNS can help you</h2>

<ul>
<li> Improves longevity (archival quality) of data
     <ul>
     <li> Self-descriptive (more on this later)
     <li> Machine-independent
     </ul>
<li> Easy to share data files between sites
     <ul>
     <li> Eliminates need to translate between different data formats
     <li> Rigorous standard means less ambiguity about what the data
          means
     </ul>
<li> Saves time and money
     <ul>
     <li> For example, easy to set-up CFD runs because files include
          grid coordinates, connectivity, and BC information
     </ul>
<li> Easily extendible to include additional types of data
     <ul>
     <li> Solver-specific or user-specific data can easily be written
          &amp; read - file remains CGNS-compliant (others can still
          read it!)
     <li> Once defined &amp; agreed upon, new data standards can be added
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Status/where CGNS is headed</h2>

<ul>
<li> Latest version is 2.4
<li> As of Aug 2005, the CGNSTalk mailing list had 161 participants from
     21 different countries and at least 80 different organizations
<li> Over 11,000 CGNS downloads from SourceForge over last 3 years
     (average of 408 per month over last 1 year)
<li> Many people have expressed interest in CGNS from outside of the
     traditional aerodynamics community
     <ul>
     <li> E.g., computational physiology, electromagnetics
     </ul>
<li> Parallel I/O (through HDF5) will be available soon
<li> CGNS is already in many widely-used commercial visualization
     products, e.g.,  Tecplot, Fieldview, ICEM-CFD (reader for Paraview
     being worked)
<li> Continuous process: approval and implementation of extensions for
     handling new capabilities
</ul>

     <li> CGNS Users Guide (practical entry-level manual for getting
          started with CGNS - includes simple source codes)
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Basics of using CGNS</h2>

<ul>
<li> Simple example: opening, closing, writing, &amp; reading Base
<li> Aspects for data longevity
     <ul>
     <li> Boundary conditions
     <li> Convergence history
     <li> Descriptor nodes
     <li> Data &amp; equation descriptions
     <li> Flowfield variables
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Opening/closing file &amp; writing Base</h2>

<ul>
<li> C
<pre>
   cg_open("grid.cgns", MODE_WRITE, <u>&amp;indexf</u>);
   basename="Base";
   icelldim=3; /* dimensionality of cell (3 for volume cell) */
   iphysdim=3; /* number of coordinates (3 for 3-D) */
   cg_base_write(indexf, basename, icelldim, iphysdim, <u>&amp;indexb</u>);
   ...
   cg_close(indexf);
</pre>
<li> Fortran
<pre>
   call cg_open_f('grid.cgns', MODE_WRITE, <u>indexf</u>, <u>ier</u>)
   basename='Base'
   icelldim=3
   iphysdim=3
   call cg_base_write_f(indexf, basename, icelldim, iphysdim, <u>indexb</u>, <u>ier</u>)
   ...
   call cg_close_f(indexf, <u>ierr</u>)
</pre>
</ul>

</center>

<p>
Notes: icelldim = dimensionality of cell (2 for face, 3 for volume),
iphysdim = no. of coordinates required to define a node position (1 for
1-D, 2 for 2-D, 3 for 3-D)

</center>

<h2>Reading the Base</h2>

<ul>
<li> C
<pre>
   cg_open('grid.cgns', MODE_READ, <u>&amp;indexf</u>);
   cg_nbases(indexf, <u>&amp;nbases</u>);
   for (i=1; i <= nbases; i++)
      {cg_base_read(indexf, i, <u>basename</u>, <u>&amp;icelldim</u>, <u>&amp;iphysdim</u>);}
   cg_close(indexf);
</pre>
<li> Fortran
<pre>
   call cg_open_f('grid.cgns', MODE_READ, <u>indexf</u>, <u>ier</u>)
   call cg_nbases_f(indexf, <u>nbases</u>, <u>ier</u>)
   do i=1,nbases
      call cg_base_read_f(indexf, i, <u>basename</u>, <u>icelldim</u>, <u>iphysdim</u>, <u>ier</u>)
   enddo
   call cg_close_f(indexf, <u>ier</u>)
</pre>
</ul>

<h2>Aspects for data longevity</h2>

<h3>boundary conditions</h3>

<ul>
<li> BCs are included in the CGNS file
<li> Including BCs makes it easier for someone else to duplicate the
     same flow conditions
<li> Eliminates doubt as to how the solution was run, when later looking
     at the file
<li> BCs can be simple or have high level of detail
     <ul>
     <li> Minimum: list of points and their BC type (name)
     <li> Can also include Dirichlet or Neumann-type data
     </ul>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="RUMSEY_tutorial/fig6.png"
     alt="ADFviewer window with boundary condition node"
     longdesc="RUMSEY_tutorial/fig6.html">
</center>

<h3>convergence history</h3>

<ul>
<li> GlobalConvergenceHistory tracks history of residual(s), forces,
     moments, etc.
<li> Part of a complete record of the flow solution, easily readable by
     others
</ul>

<center>
<img src="RUMSEY_tutorial/fig7.png"
     alt="ADFviewer window with convergence history node"
     longdesc="RUMSEY_tutorial/fig7.html">
</center>

<h3>descriptor nodes</h3>

<ul>
<li> Allow user to add notes, descriptions, important factors associated
     with the particular run, etc.
<li> As part of the permanent record, descriptor nodes make the file
     potentially more useful/meaningful in the future
<li> Full inclusion of flow solver input deck(s) is particularly useful
<li> Eliminates doubt as to how the solution was run, when later looking
     at the file
</ul>

     alt="ADFviewer window with descriptor node containing input file"
     longdesc="RUMSEY_tutorial/fig9.html">
</center>

<h3>data &amp; equation descriptions</h3>

<ul>
<li> Documents the dimensionality &amp; units (or normalization) of the
     data
<li> Reference state and flow solution method become part of permanent
     record
<li> Eliminates doubt as to what the variables represent and how the
     solution was run, when later looking at the fileo
</ul>

<img src="RUMSEY_tutorial/fig12.png"
     alt="ADFviewer window with governing equations node"
     longdesc="RUMSEY_tutorial/fig12.html">
</center>

<h3>flowfield variables</h3>

<ul>
<li> As many flowfield variables as desired can be stored; for example:
     <ul>
     <li> Conserved and/or primitive variables
     <li> Plus all turbulence quantities, eddy viscosity, distance
          functions, species mass fractions, or other flowfield
          quantities of interest
     </ul>
<li> Eliminates having to go back and restart or reconstruct when you
     want to obtain nonstandard quantities
</ul>

<h2>Some final comments</h2>

<ul>
<li> A CGNS file can be as full or as sparse as you want to make it
     <ul>
     <li> The fuller it is, the more complete and archival the file
     <li> Always easy to read only the parts you want
     </ul>
<li> Easy to build CGNS into existing processes
     <ul>
     <li> Start by writing only the "basic" elements of CGNS file
          (e.g., grid, flow solution, connectivity, and BCs) as a
          postprocessing file for flow visualization
     <li> Gradually add to completeness of file
     <li> Eventually, CGNS file can replace your restart file, if
          desired
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<ul>
<li> CGNS is a well-established, stable format with worldwide
     acceptance, use, and support
<li> Provides seamless communication of data between applications,
     sites, and system architectures
<li> Supported by many commercial visualization and CFD vendors
<li> Extensible and flexible - easily adapted to other fields of
     computational physics through specification in the SIDS
<li> Backward compatible with previous versions; forward compatible
     within major release numbers
<li> Allows new software development to focus on important matters,
     rather than on time-consuming data I/O, storage, and compatibility
     issues
<li> CGNS is the best thing since sliced bread!
