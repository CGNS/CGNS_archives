This is an image of the ADFviewer main window showing the CGNS file
structure after the fourth part of the example.
It shows the same node tree as described after the
<a href="fig7.html">third part of the example</a> but with the
Prisms node expanded.

<p>
Below the Prisms node are nodes named "ElementRange" and
"ElementConnectivity", each marked with a file icon.

<p>
In the node tree the ElementConnectivity node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Base/Main/Prisms", the node name is ElementConnectivity, and the node
label is DataArray_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is R4, the dimensions
value is 6646482, and the bytes value is 26585928.
The element connectivity data are shown in the node data panel.
