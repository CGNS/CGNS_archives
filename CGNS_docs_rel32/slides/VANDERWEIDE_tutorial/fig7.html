<p>
This is an image of the ADFviewer main window showing the CGNS file
structure after the third part of the example.
It shows the same node tree as described after the
<a href="fig6.html">second part of the example</a> but with the
GridCoordinates node expanded.

<p>
Below the GridCoordinates node are nodes named "CoordinateX",
"CoordinateY", and "CoordinateZ", each marked with a file icon.

<p>
In the node tree the CoordinateX node is highlighted.
In the node description panel, the parent node value shown is
"/Base/Main/GridCoordinates", the node name is CoordinateX, and the node
label is DataArray_t.
In the data description panel, the data type value is R8, the dimensions
value is 696894, and the bytes value is 5575152.
The x coordinate values are shown in the node data panel.
