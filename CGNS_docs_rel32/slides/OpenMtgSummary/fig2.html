This figure illustrates how CAD systems and databases may be incorporated
into a software system that uses CGNS.
At the top is a box labeled "GUI", and immediately below it is a box
labeled "User Control System", representing user-level control of
applications.
Below this are boxes representing five different types of applications:
a CAD system, a grid generator, a solver, a post-processor, and a
design/optimizer.

<p>
The CAD system uses CAD calls to read from and write into a CAD database.
The grid generator uses CAD calls to communicate with the CAD database,
and CGNS calls to communicate with a CGNS database.
The solver and post-processor both use CGNS calls to communicate with
the CGNS database.
And the design/optimizer uses CGNS calls to communicate with the CGNS
database and CAD calls to communicate with the CAD database.
