This figure is a plot of file size in bytes vs the number of points per
zone for the following six CGNS version and data format combinations.
<ul>
<li> CGNS version 3.0, ADF data format
<li> CGNS version 3.0, HDF5 data format
<li> CGNS version 3.0, XML data format
<li> CGNS version 3.0, compressed XML data format
<li> CGNS version 2.5 (mislabeled as 2.6 in the legend), ADF data format
<li> CGNS version 2.5 (mislabeled as 2.6 in the legend), HDF5 data format
</ul>

<p>
For the four largest grids the file size is essentially linear with the
number of points.
For CGNS 3.0 and 2.5 with both the ADF and HDF5 data formats, the size
varies from about 5 megabytes (0.005 gigabytes) with 10000 points per
zone to about 5 gigabytes with 10<sup>7</sup> points per zone.
Over the same range the file size for the two XML data format cases is
slightly larger, varying from about 6 megabytes to 6 gigabytes.

<p>
The data format has more effect on the file size for the two smaller
grids.
For both CGNS 3.0 and 2.5 with the HDF5 data format, the file size
varies from about 0.6 megabyte with 100 points per zone, to about 1.0
megabyte with 1000 points per zone.
Over the same range the file size for both CGNS 3.0 and 2.5 with the ADF
data format varies from about 0.2 megabyte to 0.6 megabyte, and the size
for both XML data formats varies from 0.08 megabyte to 0.6 megabyte.
