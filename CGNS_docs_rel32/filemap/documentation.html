<p>
Documentation of CGNS is found in a number of related
publications. These are maintained separately for several
reasons. First, they describe logically independent aspects of the CGNS
system. Second, many users will find that a subset of the documentation
is sufficient for their needs. And last, some portions of the system can
be viewed as independent entities useful outside the context of CGNS.

<h3>Description of the Documents</h3>

<p>
In order to make the current document as self-contained as possible,
basic information regarding all components of the CGNS standard has
been included. However, the reader should be aware of the documents
describing these other components. These should be regarded as the
authoritative and complete descriptions of their respective components
of CGNS. Each of these documents is described briefly in this section.

<a name="overview"></a>
<h4>CGNS Overview and Entry-Level Document</h4>

<p>
This is an <a href="../overview/index.html">introductory document</a>
which provides an overall view of the purpose and components of
CGNS. The Overview is intended as an entry point into CGNS.
Prospective users completely unfamiliar with CGNS should consult the
Overview to determine whether CGNS provides the capabilities they seek.

<a name="user"></a>
<h4>A User's Guide to CGNS</h4>

<p>
The <a href="../user/index.html"><i>User's Guide to CGNS</i></a> has
been written to aid users in the implementation of CGNS.
It is intended as a tutorial: light in content, but heavy in examples,
advice, and guidelines.
The guide provides a concise overview of many of the most commonly-used
features of the SIDS, and gives coding examples using the CGNS Mid-Level
Library to write and read simple CGNS files.

<a name="midlevel"></a>
<h4>CGNS Mid-Level Library</h4>

<p>
The <a href="../midlevel/index.html"><i>CGNS Mid-Level Library</i></a>
document describes a set of routines which store and retrieve the CFD
data objects defined in the SIDS.
Their purpose is to provide CGNS compliant I/O without the need for
detailed programming in the ADF or HDF Core.
These "mid-level routines" are designed to be inserted directly into
applications codes, such as flow solvers and grid generators.

<a name="sids"></a>
<h4>Standard Interface Data Structures</h4>

<p>
The <a href="../sids/index.html"><i>Standard Interface Data
Structures</i></a>, usually abbreviated as "SIDS," define the
"intellectual content" of CFD data.
They detail the data which must be stored to completely characterize
each CFD entity.
They describe, for example, what exactly is meant by a "grid" or a
"boundary condition".
They also establish a system of nomenclature which gives standard
meaning to certain names, such as "Density" and "SubsonicInflow".

<p>
The SIDS description of the CFD data is hierarchical in nature, in that
complex entities are built up out of simpler ones.
In the SIDS document, this is reflected in a syntax which uses C-like
structures to define the various entities.
The result is a tree-like structure which maps
naturally onto the ADF format. Consequently, the File Mapping described
by the current document exactly parallels the SIDS. Thus in terms of
basic structure, the Mapping itself summarizes the SIDS.
However, there are many conventions regarding the nomenclature and
meaning of data which are not summarized in the current document, and
for these the <a href="../sids/index.html">SIDS</a> is the authoritative
document.

<p>
It is worth emphasizing that the SIDS may be regarded as a stand-alone
definition of the data associated with CFD, and that these data could
be stored in any sufficiently general format, given a mapping onto that
format.

<a name="filemap"></a>
<h4>SIDS File Mapping Manual</h4>

<p>
The <a href="../filemap/index.html"><i>SIDS File Mapping Manual</i></a>
specifies the exact manner in which, under CGNS conventions, CFD data
structures (the SIDS) are to be stored in, i.e., mapped onto, the file
structure provided by a database manager.
Adherence to the mapping conventions guarantees uniform meaning
and location of CFD data within database files, and thereby allows the
construction of universal software to read and write the data.

<a name="cgio"></a>
<h4>CGIO User's Guide</h4>

<p>
The <a href="../cgio/index.html"><i>CGIO User's Guide</i></a> describes the
interface between the SIDS File Mapping and an underlying database
manager. It also documents the low-level routines that provide this
functionality as used in the Mid-Level Library. This is the preferred
way to access the database directly if additional requirements beyond
those provided by the MLL are needed.

<a name="adf"></a>
<h4>ADF Implementation</h4>

<p>
The <a href="../adf/index.html"><i>ADF Implementation</i></a> describes
one of the underlying database managers, ADF (Advanced Data Format),
which may be used to create CGNS files.
ADF is a binary format, based on a simple tree structure.
In principal, nearly any kind of data could be stored in ADF format.
ADF was, however, especially designed for the storage of large
quantities of scientific data in a platform-independent and
randomly-accessible manner.
The "ADF Core" is a set of portable routines which store and retrieve
data in ADF format.
These routines are written in C, but Fortran versions are also provided.
The <i>ADF User's Guide</i> describes both the ADF format and the ADF Core
routines in detail.

<p>
Because the CGNS File Mapping depends intimately on the format of the
underlying database manager, a <a href="../adf/summary.html">summary of ADF
data structures</a> is provided.

<p>
It should be emphasized that ADF, with its Core routines, constitutes a
very general stand-alone database manager which is not directly related
to CFD. It can therefore be used to store any kind of data <em>once it has
been specified where to place that data within the ADF format</em>.
This File Mapping document describes the CGNS conventions governing that
placement for CFD-specific data.

<a name="hdf"></a>
<h4>HDF Implementation</h4>

<p>
HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format) is another underlying database manager
that may be used to create CGNS files, and is developed and maintained
by the <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">National Center for
Supercomputing Applications</a>
<img src="../external.png" alt="external link">at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Documentation for HDF5 is available at the
<a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/">HDF5 Home Page</a>
<img src="../external.png" alt="external link">.

<p>
Like ADF, HDF5 is a binary format, based on a tree structure,
designed for the storage of large quantities of scientific data in a
platform-independent and randomly-accessible manner.
Also like ADF, HDF5 can be used to store any kind of data.
The <a href="../hdf5/index.html">HDF5 Implementation</a> document
describes the CGNS conventions governing the placement of CFD-specific
data within the HDF5 format.

<p>
The document describes the <em>node level</em> system, whereas the
Mid-Level Library can be understood as the <em>tree level</em> system.
A description is given for every Mid-Level Library type, or sub-tree, in
terms of sets of atomic nodes.
Moreover, it specifies the exact manner in which, under CGNS
conventions, CFD data structures (the SIDS) are to be mapped onto the
data structures provided by the low level layer (HDF5).

<p>
Some system-specific mechanisms, such as <em>link</em> management are
detailed.
[Please note that only the <em>final</em> representation of these
<em>links</em> are relevant, in other words the sequence of HDF5 calls
required to obtain such a representation is not important.]

<p>
Adherence to the mapping conventions guarantees uniform meaning
and location of CFD data within HDF5 files, and thereby allows the
construction of universal software to read and write the data.

<a name="which"></a>
<h3>Which Documents Do You Need?</h3>

<p>
Ideally, all users of the CGNS system will want to have all the
documents available for reference. However, many will find it possible
to begin to use the system effectively without reading all the documents
beforehand.  In fact, since the CGNS system is intended to minimize
interaction with underlying data structures, some users will find
they need very little knowledge of the system's internal workings. We
distinguish four classes of users who may wish to consult the CGNS
Documentation.

<h4>Prospective Users</h4>

<p>
Prospective users are presumably unfamiliar with CGNS. They will
probably wish to begin with the Overview, or, if they require more
detailed information, one or more of the various
<a href="../index.html#Papers">papers</a> that have been written
describing CGNS.
Beyond that, most will find a quick read of this file mapping document
enlightening as to the logical form of the contents of CGNS files.
Browsing the <a href="figures.html">figures</a> in this document, as
well as the <a href="../sids/index.html">SIDS</a> itself, will provide
some feel for the scope of the system.
The <a href="../user/index.html"><i>User's Guide to CGNS</i></a>, and
the <a href="../midlevel/index.html"><i>CGNS Mid-Level Library</i></a>
document, should give an indication of what might be required to
implement CGNS in a given application.
Prospective users should probably not concern themselves with the
details of ADF or HDF.

<h4>End Users</h4>

<p>
The end user is the practitioner of CFD who generates the grids, runs
the flow codes and/or analyzes the results.
For this user, CGNS provides a mechanism for accumulating the output of
the various processes related to CFD, e.g., grid generation and flow
solution, and for making this output available to subsequent processes
or for archiving final results.
For this user, a scan of the <a href="../overview/index.html">Overview</a>
will sufficiently explain the overall workings of the system.
This includes end user responsibilities for matters not governed by
CGNS, such as the maintenance of files and directories.
The end user will also find useful the
<a href="../user/index.html"><i>User's Guide to CGNS</i></a>, as
well as those portions of the <a href="../sids/index.html">SIDS</a>
which deal with standard nomenclature.
<a href="../papers/aiaa98-3007.pdf">AIAA 98-3007</a> may also be useful
if more details about the capabilities of CGNS are desired.

<p>
The end user is, by definition, not involved in the building of
CGNS-compliant applications code.

<h4>Applications Code Developers</h4>

<p>
The applications code developer builds or maintains code to support the
various sub-processes encountered in CFD, e.g., grid generation, flow
solution, post-processing, or flow visualization.
The code developer must be able to install CGNS compliant I/O.
The most convenient method for doing so is to utilize the CGNS Mid-Level
Library.
The <a href="../user/index.html"><i>User's Guide to CGNS</i></a> is the
starting point for learning to use the Mid-Level Library to create and
use CGNS files.
The <a href="../midlevel/index.html"><i>CGNS Mid-Level Library</i></a>
document itself should also be considered essential.
This library of routines will perform the most common I/O operations in
a CGNS-compliant manner.
However, even when the CGNS Library suffices to implement all necessary
I/O, an understanding of the <a href="../sids/index.html">SIDS</a> and the
<a href="../filemap/index.html">SIDS File mapping</a> will be useful.
It will likely be necessary to consult the
SIDS to determine the precise meaning
of the nomenclature. In the unlikely case that the MLL does not provide
all the functionality needed by the application, the
<a href="../cgio/index.html"><i>CGIO User's Guide</i></a> may be consulted
for information on the low-level access to the CGNS database.

<h4>CGNS System Developers</h4>

<p>
CGNS System development can be kept somewhat compartmentalized.
Developers responsible for the maintenance or building of supplements
to the ADF or HDF Core, need not concern themselves with documentation
other than the <a href="../adf/index.html"><i>ADF User Guide</i></a> or
the <a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/">HDF5 documentation</a>
<img src="../external.png" alt="external link">.
System developers wishing to add to the
<a href="../midlevel/index.html">CGNS Mid-Level Library</a> will need
all the documents.
Theoretical developments, such as extensions to the
<a href="../sids/index.html">SIDS</a>, may possibly be undertaken with a
knowledge of the SIDS alone, but such contributions must also be added
to the <a href="../filemap/index.html">SIDS File Mapping</a>
before they can be implemented.

<h3>How to Use This Document</h3>

<p>
Those wishing to do more than simply browse this document
will find that the detailed information begins with the
the <a href="general.html">General File Mapping Concepts</a>.
The <a href="nodes.html">detailed textual node descriptions</a> in are
more useful as reference than as sequential literature.
The best overall technical view of the layout of CGNS files can be
acquired by reference to the <a href="figures.html">figures</a>.
