<h3>Node - The Building Block</h3>

A database is a hierarchical system that is built around
the concept of a "node".
Each node contains information about itself and its ancestors and
possibly data (e.g., arrays, vectors, character strings, etc.).
Each of these nodes, in turn, may be connected to an arbitrary number of
children, each of which is itself a node.
In this system, a node contains user-accessible information related
to identification, name, type, and amount of data associated with it,
and pointers to child nodes.
Basic nodal information includes:

<ul>
<li> a unique ID (node locator)
<li> a name (character string) used to describe the node and its data
<li> a label (character string) an additional field used to describe the
     node and its data.
     It is analogous to, but not exactly the same as, the name.
<li> information describing the type and amount of data
<li> data
<li> IDs of child nodes
</ul>

<p>
There are no restrictions on the number of child nodes that a node can
have associated with it in the database.
This structure allows the construction of a hierarchical system as
shown in the figure below.
As illustrated in the figure, it is possible to reference nodes in a
second file (<i>File_Two</i>) from the original file
(<i>File_One</i>).
This is the concept of "linking."

<a name="example"></a>
<p>

<img src="figure.gif"

<br><br>
Example Database Hierarchy of Nodes
</center>

<p>
A node knows about itself and its children, but it does not know
anything about its parent.
This means that it is possible to traverse "down" the tree by making
queries about what lies below the current node, but it is not possible
to traverse "up" the tree by making queries about nodes above a given
node.
If it is desired to move back up the tree, the user must keep track of
that information.

<p>
All database files start with a root node, which is created automatically
when a new file is opened.
There is only one root node in a database file, and may be referenced
by the database Root ID or by name as "/".

<a name="attributes"></a>
<h3>Node Attributes</h3>

Each node in the database may have zero to many subnodes that are
associated with it, as well as its own data.
The following are a list of attributes accessible by the user for a node
in the hierarchical database system.

<br><br>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0>
<tr valign=baseline><td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>
   <td>Data<td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>
   <td>The data associated with a node.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Data Type<td>
   <td>A 2-byte character field, blank filled, case sensitive.
       Specifies the type of data (e.g., real, integer, character)
       associated with this node.
       The <a href="#t:datatype">supported data types</a> are listed below.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Dimensions<td>
   <td>An integer vector containing the number of elements within
       each dimension.
       For example, if the array <tt>A</tt> was declared (Fortran) as
       <tt>A(10,20)</tt>, the Dimension vector would contain two entries
       (10,20).
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>ID<td>
   <td>A unique identifier to access a given node within a file.
       This field contains sufficient information for the database manager
       to locate the node within a file.
       For any given node, the ID is generated only after the file it
       resides in has been opened by a program and the user requests
       information about the node.
       The ID is valid only within the program that opened the file and
       while that file is open.
       If the file is closed and reopened, the ID for any given node
       may be different.
       Within different programs, the node ID for the same node may
       also be different.
       The ID is never actually written into a file.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Label<td>
   <td>A 32-byte character field.
       The rules for Labels are identical to those for Names.
       Unlike names, Labels do not have to be unique.
       The Label field was introduced to allow "data typing" similar to
       the "typedef" concept in C.
       Using the Label field in this way allows programs to know some
       additional information about the use of the node itself or its
       child nodes and to call specific subroutines to read the data or
       react in specific ways upon detection of the type.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Name<td>
   <td>A 32-byte character field.
       The names of child nodes directly attached to a parent node must
       be unique.
       For example, in the <a href="#example">example database
       figure</a>, all nodes directly attached to N3 must have unique names.
       When a request to create a new node is made, the database manager
       checks the requested name against the other names of the child nodes
       of the specified parent.
       If the requested name is not unique, an error is returned.
       <br><br>
       Legal characteristics of a name are a A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and special
       characters (ASCII values from 32 to 126, except for the forward
       slash "/" (ASCII number 47)).
       Names will be blank filled to 32 bytes; they are case sensitive.
       Leading blanks are discarded and trailing blanks are ignored,
       whereas internal blanks are significant.
       <br><br>
       <em>Note</em>: Names passed from C must have the null "\0"
       character appended to them.
       Names returned through the C interface will have the
       null character appended to them.
       Therefore, C programs should allocate 33 bytes for any Name in
       order to accommodate the null character.
       <br><br>
       Fortran programs can allocate 32 characters for Names.
       The Fortran interface takes care of adding or removing the null
       character as required.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Names of Subnodes<td>
   <td>A list of names of the subnodes (children) of a node.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Number of Dimensions<td>
   <td>The dimensionality of the data.
       All data is viewed as an array with from zero (i.e., no
       data) to 12 dimensions.
       A "0" is used if the data type is empty.
       Thus, a scalar is viewed as a vector with one dimension and
       length 1.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Number of Subnodes<td>
   <td>The number of child nodes directly attached to any given node.
       Each node can have zero or more child nodes directly associated
       with it.

<p>
The "<tt>MT</tt>" node contains no data, and is typically used as a
container for subnodes (children).

<p>
A link is denoted by "<tt>LK</tt>", and defines the
linkage between nodes and subnodes. A link provides a mechanism for
referring to a node that physically resides in a different part of the
hierarchy or a different database file. The link parallels a soft link
in the UNIX operating system in that it does not guarantee that the
referenced node exists. The database manager will "resolve" the link
only when information is requested about the linked node or it's children.

   <td>One of the subnodes of a Parent.

       The user must keep track of this relationship.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;

<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;

   <td>ID<td>
   <td>A unique identifier to access a given node within a database file.
       This field contains sufficient information for the database manager
       to locate the node within a file.
       For any given node, the ID is generated only after the file it
       resides in has been opened by a program and the user requests
       information about the node.
       The ID is valid only within the program that opened the file and
       while that file is open.
       If the file is closed and reopened, the ID for any given node
       may be different. Within different programs, the node-ID for the
       same node may also be different.
       The ID is never actually written into a file.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Link-Node<a name="link"></a><td>
   <td>A special type of node.
       Links are created using the
       <a href="links.html#create_link"><tt>cgio_create_link</tt></a>
       subroutine. The data type of this node is <tt>LK</tt>,
       and its data is a one-dimensional array containing the name of the
       file (if other than the current file) containing the node to be
       linked and the full path name in that file from the root node
       to the desired node.
       <br><br>
       Links provide a mechanism for referring to a node that physically
       resides in a different part of the hierarchy.
       The node pointed to by a link may or may not reside in the same
       file as the link itself.
       A link is very similar to a "soft" link in the
       UNIX operating system in that it does not guarantee that the
       referenced node exists. The database manager
       will "resolve" the link only when information is requested
       about the node. If the ID of a link-node is used in an CGIO call,
       the effect of the call is the same as if the ID of the
       linked-to node was actually used.
       Note that a link node does not have children itself.
       In the <a href="#example">example database</a>
       figure, the children seen for <tt>L3</tt> are <tt>F4</tt> and
       <tt>F5</tt>.
       If a child is "added" to <tt>L3</tt>, then in reality, the child
       is added to <tt>F3</tt>.
       There are specialized <a href="links.html">subroutines</a> provided
       to create link nodes and extract the link details.

   <td>The single component used to construct a database.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Node&nbsp;name<td>
   <td>A node has a 32-character name.
       Every child node directly under a given parent must have a unique
       name.
       Legal characteristics in a name are <tt>A-Z</tt>, <tt>a-z</tt>,
       <tt>0-9</tt>, and special characters (ASCII values from 32 to
       126, omitting the forward slash "<tt>/</tt>", ASCII number 47).
       Names will be blank filled to 32 bytes; they are case sensitive.
       Leading blanks are discarded and trailing blanks are ignored,
       whereas internal blanks are significant.

<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Parent<td>
   <td>A node that has subnodes directly associated with it.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Pathname<td>
   <td>Within a database, nodes can be referenced using the name of a node
       along with its parent ID, or by using a "pathname" whose syntax is
       roughly the same as a path name in the UNIX environment.
       A pathname that begins with a leading slash "<tt>/</tt>" is
       assumed to begin at the root node of the file.
       If no leading slash is given, the name is assumed to begin at the
       node specified by the parent ID.
       Although there is a 32-character limitation on the node Name,
       there is no restriction on the length of the pathname.
       For example, equivalent ways to refer to node <tt>N8</tt> in the
       hierarchy in the <a href="#example">example database</a> figure are:
       <ul>
       <li> Node-ID for <tt>N6</tt> and name = "<tt>N8</tt>"
       <li> Node-ID for <tt>N4</tt> and name = "<tt>N6/N8</tt>"
       <li> Node-ID for <tt>N1</tt> and name = "<tt>N4/N6/N8</tt>"
       <li> Node-ID for the <tt>Root_Node</tt> and name =
            "<tt>/N1/N4/N6/N8</tt>"

       <i>cgns_io.h</i> has a number of variables defined.
       An example declaration would be:

       An example declaration would be:
       <pre>
   PARAMETER CGIO_MAX_NAME_LENGTH=32
   CHARACTER*(CGIO_MAX_NAME_LENGTH) NAME
       </pre>
       or include the Fortran header file <i>cgns_io_f.h</i> which
       defines these parameters.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>ID<td>
   <td>A unique identifier to access a given node within a database.
       For any given node, the ID is generated only after the file it
       resides in has been opened by a program and the user requests
       information about the node.
       The ID is valid only within the program that opened the file and
       while that file is open.
       If the file is closed and reopened, the ID for any given node
       may be different.
       Within different programs, the node ID for the same node may
       also be different.
       The ID is not ever actually written into a file.
       <br><br>
       The declaration for variables that will hold node IDs should be
       for an 8-byte real number.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Indexing<td>
   <td>All indexing is Fortran-like in that the starting index is 1 and
       the last is <tt>N</tt> for <i>N</i> items in an index or array
       dimension.
       The array structure is assumed to be the same as in Fortran
       with the first array dimension varying the fastest and the last
       dimension varying the slowest.
       <br><br>
       The index starting at one is used in
       <a href="dataio.html#read_data"><tt>cgio_read_data</tt></a>,
       <a href="dataio.html#write_data"><tt>cgio_write_data</tt></a>,
       <a href="structure.html#children_names"><tt>cgio_children_names</tt></a>,
       and <a href="structure.html#children_ids"><tt>cgio_children_ids</tt></a>.
       <br><br>
       The user should be aware of the differences in array indexing
       between Fortran and C.
       The subroutines
       <a href="dataio.html#read_all_data"><tt>cgio_read_all_data</tt></a> and
       <a href="dataio.html#write_all_data"><tt>cgio_write_all_data</tt></a>
       merely take a pointer to the beginning of the data, compute how
       much data is to be read/written, and process as many bytes as
       have been requested.
       Thus, these routines effectively make a copy of memory onto disk
       or vice versa.
       Given this convention, it is possible for a C program to
       use standard C conventions for array indexing and use
       <tt>cgio_write_all_data</tt> to store the array on disk.
       Then a Fortran program might use <tt>cgio_read_all_data_f</tt> to
       read the data set.
       Unless the user is aware of the structure of the data, it is
       possible for the array to be transposed relative to what is
       expected.
       <br><br>
       The implications of the assumed array structure convention can be
       quite subtle.
       The subroutines <tt>cgio_write_data</tt> and
       <tt>cgio_read_data</tt> assume the Fortran array structure in
       order to index the data.
       Again, unless the user is aware of the implications of this, it
       is possible to write an array on disk and later try to change a
       portion of the data and not change the correct numbers.
       <br><br>
       As long as users are aware of how their data structure maps onto
       the database, there will not be any problems.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td><tt>return codes</tt><td>
   <td>The CGIO routines return an integer code indicating whether they
       were successfull or not. On success, 0 (<tt>CGIO_ERR_NONE</tt>) is
       returned. A non-zero return indicates an error. Return codes &lt; 0
       indicate an error at the CGIO level; codes &gt; 0 indicate an
       error in the database manager. See
