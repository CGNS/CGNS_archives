<p>
This diagram illustrates an example ADF hierarchical database, with
parent and child nodes, node IDs, and links.
The database consists of two files - <i>ADF_File_One</i> and
<i>ADF_File_Two</i>.

<p>
At the top in the file <i>ADF_File_One</i> is the Root node.
At the first level below the Root node are three child nodes (i.e.,
sub-nodes), with IDs <tt>N1</tt>, <tt>N2</tt>, and <tt>N3</tt>.

<p>
<tt>N1</tt> has the following three children at the next lower level.
<ul>
<li> <tt>N4</tt>, which has children <tt>N6</tt> and <tt>N7</tt>.
     <tt>N6</tt> in turn has a single child node <tt>N8</tt>.
<li> <tt>L3</tt>, which is a link node, described later.
<li> <tt>N5</tt>, which has no child nodes.
</ul>

<p>
The second node at the first level below the Root node, <tt>N2</tt>, has
no children.

<p>
The third node just below the Root node, <tt>N3</tt>, has the following
three children at the next lower level.
<ul>
<li> <tt>N9</tt>, which has children <tt>N12</tt> and <tt>N13</tt>.
<li> <tt>N10</tt>, which has children <tt>L1</tt> and <tt>N14</tt>
<li> <tt>N11</tt>, which has children <tt>L2</tt> and <tt>N15</tt>.
</ul>
<tt>L1</tt> and <tt>L2</tt> are both link nodes, described later.

<p>
In the file <i>ADF_File_Two</i>, there is again a Root node at the
top level, with children <tt>F1</tt>, <tt>F2</tt>, and <tt>F3</tt>.
<tt>F1</tt> and <tt>F2</tt> have no child nodes, while
<tt>F3</tt> has children <tt>F4</tt> and <tt>F5</tt>.

<p>
The <a href="glossary.html#link">link nodes</a> <tt>L1</tt>,
<tt>L2</tt>, and <tt>L3</tt> in the file <i>ADF_File_One</i> point to
other nodes in the ADF database.
<tt>L1</tt> and <tt>L2</tt> are both links to the node <tt>N13</tt>
in the same file, <i>ADF_File_One</i>.
<tt>L3</tt> is a link to the node <tt>F3</tt> in the file
<i>ADF_File_Two</i>.
