<h2>The ADF Software Library</h2>

<li> <a href="#acquiring">Acquiring the Software and Documentation</a>
</ul>

<p>
The ADF library is a hierarchical database system that is built around
the concept of a "node".
Each node contains information about itself and its ancestors and
possibly data (e.g., arrays, vectors, character strings, etc.).
Each of these nodes, in turn, can be connected to an arbitrary number of
children, each of which is itself a node.
In this system, an ADF node contains user-accessible information related
to identification, name, type, and amount of data associated with it,
and pointers to child nodes.
Basic nodal information includes:

<ul>
<li> a unique ID (essentially a file location pointer)
<li> a name (character string) used to describe the node and its data
<li> a label (character string) an additional field used to describe the
     node and its data.
     It is analogous to, but not exactly the same as, the name.
<li> information describing the type and amount of data
<li> data
<li> IDs of child nodes
</ul>

<p>
There are no restrictions on the number of child nodes that a node can
have associated with it in the ADF database.
This structure allows the construction of a hierarchical database as
shown in the figure below.
As illustrated in the figure, it is possible to reference nodes in a
second file (<i>ADF_File_Two</i>) from the original file
(<i>ADF_File_One</i>).
This is the concept of "linking."

Example Database Hierarchy of Nodes
</center>

<p>
A node knows about itself and its children, but it does not know
anything about its parent.
This means that it is possible to traverse "down" the tree by making
queries about what lies below the current node, but it is not possible
to traverse "up" the tree by making queries about nodes above a given
node.
If it is desired to move back up the tree, the user must keep track of
that information.

<p>
All ADF files start with the root node, named "ADF MotherNode".
This node is created automatically when a new file is opened.
There is only one root node in an ADF file.

<a name="node"></a>
<h3>ADF Node Attributes</h3>

<p>
There is a single building block called a node (see the
<a href="#f:example">example database</a> figure) used to construct the
hierarchical structure.
Each node may have zero to many subnodes that are associated with it, as
well as its own data.
The following are a list of attributes accessible by the user for a node
in the ADF hierarchical database system.

<br><br>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0>
<tr valign=baseline><td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>
   <td>Child Table<td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>
   <td>A table of file pointers and names for each of the node's
       children.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Data<td>
   <td>The data associated with a node.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Data Type<td>
   <td>A 32-byte character field, blank filled, case sensitive.
       Specifies the type of data (e.g., real, integer, complex)
       associated with this node.
       The <a href="#t:datatype">supported data types</a> are listed below.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Dimensions<td>
   <td>An integer vector containing the number of elements within
       each dimension.
       For example, if the array <tt>A</tt> was declared (Fortran) as
       <tt>A(10,20)</tt>, the Dimension vector would contain two entries
       (10,20).
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>ID<td>
   <td>A unique identifier to access a given node within a file.
       This field contains sufficient information for ADF to locate the
       node within a file.
       For any given node, the ID is generated only after the file it
       resides in has been opened by a program and the user requests
       information about the node.
       The ID is valid only within the program that opened the file and
       while that file is open.
       If the file is closed and reopened, the ID for any given node
       will be different.
       Within different programs, the node ID for the same node will be
       different.
       The ID is never actually written into a file.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Label<td>
   <td>A 32-byte character field.
       The rules for Labels are identical to those for Names.
       Unlike names, Labels do not have to be unique.
       The Label field was introduced to allow "data typing" similar to
       the "typedef" concept in C.
       Using the Label field in this way allows programs to know some
       additional information about the use of the node itself or its
       child nodes and to call specific subroutines to read the data or
       react in specific ways upon detection of the type.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Name<td>
   <td>A 32-byte character field.
       The names of child nodes directly attached to a parent node must
       be unique.
       For example, in the <a href="#f:example">example database
       figure</a>, all nodes directly attached to N3 must have unique names.
       When a request to create a new node is made, ADF checks the
       requested name against the other names of the child nodes of the
       specified parent.
       If the requested name is not unique, ADF returns an error.
       <br><br>
       Legal characteristics of a name are a A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and special
       characters (ASCII values from 32 to 126, except for the forward
       slash "/" (ASCII number 47)).
       Names will be blank filled to 32 bytes; they are case sensitive.
       Leading blanks are discarded and trailing blanks are ignored,
       whereas internal blanks are significant.
       <br><br>
       <em>Note</em>: Names passed to ADF from C must have the null "\0"
       character appended to them.
       Names returned from ADF through the C interface will have the
       null character appended to them.
       Therefore, C programs should allocate 33 bytes for any Name in
       order to accommodate the null character.
       <br><br>
       Fortran programs can allocate 32 characters for Names.
       The Fortran interface takes care of adding or removing the null
       character as required.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Names of Subnodes<td>
   <td>A list of names of the subnodes (children) of a node.
       (This is the information contained in the child table.)
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Number of Dimensions<td>
   <td>The dimensionality of the data.
       ADF views all data as an array and can handle from zero (i.e., no
       data) to 12 dimensions.
       A "0" is used if the data type is empty.
       Thus, a scalar is viewed as a vector with one dimension and
       length 1.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Number of Subnodes<td>
   <td>The number of child nodes directly attached to any given node.
       Each node can have zero or more child nodes directly associated
       with it.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Pointer<td>
   <td>An address, from the point of view of a programming language.
       Pointers are like jumps, leading from one part of the data
       structure to another.

<h4>Data Type Definitions</h4>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0>
<tr valign=baseline><td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>
   <td>Structure<td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>
   <td>It is possible to define a "structure" in ADF similar to the way
       that "struct" is defined in the C programming language.
       ADF will treat each instance of the structure as a single
       instance of data.
       A structure is described by using a string.
       For example: "<tt>I4,I4,R8,R4</tt>".
       <br><br>
       <i>Notes:</i>
       <ul>
       <li> Structures can be only as complex as can be described in 32
            characters.
       <li> This construct is not very portable; therefore, its use is
            highly discouraged.
       </ul>
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Character<td>
   <td>A character type is intended for ASCII-type character information.
       There may be different system architectures that use different
       representations for translating data.
       Byte data type should be used for pure byte or bit data usage.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Precision<td>
   <td>The <tt>R4</tt> and <tt>R8</tt> are single and double precision,
       respectively, on a 32-bit system architecture.
       On the Cray, single precision is <tt>R8</tt> and double precision
       may be <tt>R8</tt> or <tt>R16</tt>, depending on the compile
       settings.
       ADF tracks the number of bits to guarantee precision.
<tr valign=baseline><td>&nbsp;
<tr valign=baseline><td>
   <td>Link<td>
   <td>A link is denoted by "<tt>LK</tt>" in the table of
       <a href="#t:datatype">supported data types</a> and defines the
       linkage between nodes and subnodes.
       A link provides a mechanism for referring to a node that
       physically resides in a different part of the hierarchy or a
       different file.
       A link within ADF parallels a soft link in the UNIX operating
       system in that it does not guarantee that the referenced node
       exists.
       ADF will "resolve" the link only when information is requested
       about the linked node.
