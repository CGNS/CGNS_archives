<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Telecon Minutes</h2>

1 April 2009

<p>
<ol>
<li> The telecon was called to order at 11:05 AM eastern time. There were
     <a href="#attendees">6 attendees</a>, listed below.
<p>
<li> The minutes of the <a href="meeting_jan09.html">07 January 2009
     meeting</a> were approved as posted on the web site.
<p>
<li> EUCASS meeting in France
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Poinot and Hauser will run an all-day special event at the
          EUCASS meeting in early July 2009 in Versailles, France.
          The all-day event will consist of a tutorial session,
          hands-on workstation demos, industrial presentations, and a
          meeting. Rumsey, Poinot, and Hauser have developed a poster
          for Poinot to print for the meeting. <u>Poinot to organize the
          industrial presentations for EUCASS.</u>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> CGNS for Drag Prediction Workshop
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Recall from the previous meeting that the Drag Prediction
          Workshop (DPW) committee would like to move toward CGNS as the
          official format for their grids, particularly as part of their
          mesh quality evaluation. There may be opportunities for CGNS
          discussions/talks at the AIAA San Antonio meeting in June or
          at next January's ASM in Orlando. <u>Rumsey to contact Michael
          (Boeing) regarding the status of the CGNS-for-DPW effort,
          as well as to try to obtain tools for posting on the CGNS
          website.</u>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> CGNS for AIAA SBLI-challenge workshop
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> <u>Rumsey to contact Benek to see whether CGNS can play a part
          of the SBLI-challenge workshop.</u>  Currently, it appears
          that the workshop provides no grids. See the website:
          <a href="http://sbliworkshop.engin.umich.edu/html/">http://sbliworkshop.engin.umich.edu/html/</a>.
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Status of Version 3.0
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Recall previous discussion: Poinot considered adding a new
          flag to file, to indicate what the ordering inside the file
          is, but others felt that this gives too many options and
          complicates the reading.  The problem is that a bug was
          discovered in the software last year, so Poinot's group has
          many CGNS HDF-5 files with the incorrect index ordering
          (written before the bug was fixed). General consensus at
          an earlier meeting was to enforce C-ordering in HDF-5
          files. I.e., corrupted files will need to be fixed via some
          external utility; there should be no additional flag or node
          added in the file.
     <li> However, in pursuing this, Hauser wants to make sure that V3.0
          will work correctly with Poinot's (or anyone else's) old HDF5
          files that were written with incorrect index ordering. <u>Hauser
          to make a proposal regarding handling index ordering in V3.0
          and will hold a special mini-telecon in mid-April to try to
          finalize how to handle it.</u>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Other issues
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Towne retiring - probably at end of May. He is seeking someone
          at NASA Glenn to take over his CGNS-documentation-handling
          duties, so that NASA Glenn will continue to have
          representation on the committee.  However, it may be better
          for the documentation website (currently 45 MB in size) to be
          moved to Sourceforge.  Rumsey said we may need to reduce the
          website's current size first, because Sourceforge has size
          restrictions. Decision on this will be deferred until Towne
          meets with others at Glenn. Rumsey may at least take over the
          monitoring of CGNSTalk.
     <li> CGNS.org website - This long process of transferring the
          domain name of CGNS.org from Ansys to Utah State (Hauser)
          is nearing completion. Payment has been made for the domain
          name, but full transfer is awaiting final actions by Ansys. In
          the mean time, the website has still been reachable via
          http://cgns.sourceforge.net/.
          <u>Hauser to announce to CGNSTalk that CGNS.org is back up
          and running as soon as the domain transfer is successfully
          concluded.</u>
     <li> Two bugs have been raised on CGNSTalk. Someone needs to follow
          up on these. <u>Hauser to investigate and fix bugs noted
          by Magnan (CGNSTalk 04 Feb 2009) regarding declaration of
          <tt>cg_model_read</tt>, and by Edwards (CGNSTalk 27 March
          2009) regarding <tt>ADF_Read_Block_Data</tt>.</u>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Status of previous action items
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Hauser to test Version 3 compression capability prior to
          release.

     <li> Hauser &amp; Wedan to complete and release V3.0.
          <ol type=i>

               first.
          </ol>
     <li> Poinot to work with Power and others to bring Rigid Motion
          Improvement proposal to completion, including specific
          examples.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Not done yet. Poinot still needs to provide examples to
               Power. Action carries.
          </ol>
     <li> Hauser will add HDF-5 parallel code to SourceForge and will
          let users know when it is available.

     <li> Hauser to contact members of the HPC Consortium to explore
          possibility of CGNS contributing to their effort.

          </ol>
     <li> Duque and Hauser to continue to develop proposal for handling
          sprays of unconnected points.

          <li> Action carries.
          </ol>
     <li> Wedan to investigate issue of MLL deleting the entire node
          even though its new dimensions are the same.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Action carries.
          </ol>
     <li> Hauser will take control of cgns.org domain name and will
          consider possibility of moving website to Utah State site.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Control has been transferred, but some action by Ansys
               is still required. <u>Hauser will oversee completion of
               cgns.org domain transfer.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Wedan to look into issue brought up by Miller (10/19/07) to
          write info one element at a time to save memory.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Action carries.
          </ol>
     <li> Wedan to implement patch sent to him by Bussoletti to fix
          excessive memory usage by MLL.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Action carries.
          </ol>
     <li> Hauser will contact Alonso to see if he is interested in
          rejoining the CGNS steering committee.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Action item transferred to Rumsey.
          </ol>
     <li> Rumsey will ping Hunten to find out the current status of the
          ISO/STEP effort.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Done. Status reported in <a href="meeting_jan09.html">07
               Jan 09 minutes</a>.
          </ol>
     <li> Power will provide some high-level routines for
          reading/writing CGNS that may be useful, for inclusion on the
          website.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Not done yet. These are still being worked. Ultimately,
               they will come from Todd Michal at Boeing. Rumsey will
               contact Michal about this.
          </ol>
     <li> Hauser will investigate both the "<tt>long</tt>" vs
          "<tt>int</tt>" issue as well as the problem with the 64-bit
          <tt>cg_goto_f</tt>, and report back.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> HDF uses <tt>long long</tt> type. A problem is that C++
               does not support this. Committee recommended moving
               forward in spite of C++ issue and making it work
               with HDF (using <tt>long long</tt>), because we are
               already running into the limit for big grids. <u>Hauser
               to proceed with fix for both the "<tt>long</tt>" vs
               "<tt>int</tt>" issue as well as the problem with the
               64-bit <tt>cg_goto_f</tt>.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Rumsey will notify people via CGNSTalk about the upcoming CGNS
          activities at the EUCASS meeting in France.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Done.
          </ol>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Meeting was adjourned at 12:00 PM Eastern. Next Telecon date for
     the full steering committee is tentatively Wed, May 20, 11 AM
