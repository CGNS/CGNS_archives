<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Meeting Minutes</h2>

6 January 2003<br>
7:00pm<br>
Reno, Nevada

<br><br>
<b>Call to order</b> -
Bob Bush called the meeting to order at 7:00.

<br><br>
<b>Attendance</b> -
There were 17 attendees, <a href="#attendees">listed below</a>.

<br><br>
<b>Approval of minutes of last meeting</b> -
The minutes were approved as posted on the web.

<br><br>
<b>Charter Business</b> -
Chris Rumsey of NASA Langley was elected as new chairperson of the CGNS
steering committee.  He will serve a 2 year term.

<br><br>
<b>ISO Status</b> -
Ray Cosner provided an overview of the ISO standard development effort.
Hierarchically, the CGNS model consists of the following parts.  At
the top is AP 237 (Fluid Dynamics Data).  Under this is Part 110 (CFD
Models), which was at one time removed, but then restored in Oct 2002.
Under this are Part 50 (Mathematical Constructs) - which already exists
under ISO, Part 52 (Mesh Based Data), and Part 53 (Numerical Analysis).
Under these 3 parts is Part 21 (Clear-Text Encoding) - which already
exists under ISO.

<p>
By Ray's estimates, if all goes well AP 237, and Parts 52, and 53, and
110 will be voted as draft international standards by Jun 03 - Mar 04,
and voted as international standards by Jan 04 - May 05 (2/3 vote needed
from 19 countries).  An alternative to Part 21 will need to be tackled
in the future if the ISO standard is to include binary representation
of data (currently the ISO standard is ASCII).  The committee had some
discussion about this issue.  It was suggested that the committee
advocate HDF 5 to replace ADF as the binary representation.  HDF 5 has
many tools and capabilities, including parallel capabilities.  Also, ISO
committee members are already leaning that way.  Ray would like to hear
from anyone by the end of February 2003 if they have any concerns or
issues about HDF 5.  Chris Rumsey agreed to solicit an e-mail exchange
about HDF 5 between Powers, Edwards, Michal, Cosner, Bush, and Poinot.

<p>
The use of gzipped XML was also discussed as a possibility for ASCII
representation.

<p>
Ray again suggested the need for a workshop (at Lockheed, Ft Worth)
for CGNS steering committee members to go through the ISO documents in
detail.  This workshop was originally suggested for Fall 2002, but was
postponed.  It was also suggested that a subcommittee be formed to go
through Part 52 in detail, and make sure that it is still aligned with
the latest CGNS SIDS constructs.  Chris Rumsey agreed to solicit input
from Bussoletti, Poirier, Michal, Bush, and Cosner on this issue.

<p>
Ray informed the committee that he has a new job within Boeing, and he
will need to identify a new project leader at some point in the future
to take over the CGNS ISO effort.

<br><br>
<b>Documentation</b> -
Craig Day (standards engineer at AIAA) announced that the printed
version of the SIDS document (Recommended Practice R-101-2002) is
complete and is available from the AIAA on-line store. Charlie Towne
could not be present, but indicated to the Chairman via e-mail that once
the AIAA version is complete, he will update our version, labeling it as
a Draft Recommended Practice and adding a link to the AIAA on-line store
web site.  He will also make the AIAA version available as a PDF file.

<p>
Towne made a note that the Recommended Practice is basically version
2.1.6 of the SIDS document, dated 2 Nov 2001, and corresponds to CGNS
software release 2.0, Rev 3.  Version 2.1 of the software was released
in May 2002; version 2.2 in beta, and may become "official" soon.  The
Recommended Practice thus doesn't include the data structures for
chemistry or user-defined data (in version 2.1 of the software), or the
data structures for axisymmetry, rotating coordinates, special grid
connectivity properties, special boundary condition properties, or
gravity (in version 2.2 beta of the software).  It also doesn't include
various corrections and clarifications that have been added in the last
year or so.  Charlie suggests that once version 2.2 of the software
becomes official (i.e., non-beta), that we update the AIAA Recommended
Practice.  The revised documentation for Version 2.1 is now installed
on the web in the default locations.  The older documentation is still
available via other links.

<br><br>
<b>Extensions</b> -
John Bussoletti mentioned that currently the SIDS is lacking in some
respects for unstructured CFD representation.  For example, there is
no official place to store number of edges.  These can be placed under
UserDefined for the time being. Also it was mentioned that the SIDS
currently does not allow an unstructured GridLocation to be anything
other than Vertex or CellCenter.  Bussoletti said that he planned to
eventually propose some changes to the way SIDS handles unstructured
data sets, as official extensions.

<br><br>
<b>Related Software Status</b> -
David Edwards reported that Intelligent Light recently won an SBIR Phase
1 from NASA that involves CGNS usage in post-processing large data sets.

<p>
Bruce Wedan reported on the status of adfviewer and related tools.  He
is still working on documentation of this software.  Through e-mail,
Charlie Towne mentioned that he plans to update the web documentation to
include adfviewer.  But he would like to wait until documentation for
the additional utilities that Bruce wrote can also be made available,
especially since they can be accessed through ADFViewer.

<p>
At the last Telecon, it was agreed that Version 2.2 would be removed
from beta status as of January 2003.  However, Bruce has recently made a
lot of minor changes to the API beta software, so the decision to remove
the beta status has been deferred for the time being and will be taken
up again at the next telecon.

<p>
The use of SourceForge as a possible location for distributing CGNS
software (and for having outside users upload modifications and
additions) was discussed.  For example, Kessler uses SourceForge to
distribute CGNS++ (C++ interface for CGNS). Bruce Wedan agreed to look
into this possibility.

<br><br>
<b>Issues</b> -
New ideas were solicited for directions that the CGNS committee should
take this year.  Some of the ideas (and needs) that surfaced were as
follows:

<ul>
<li> Discussion of need for FORTRAN 95 extension - but we already have
     2 mid-level libraries (C and C++) ... too many?  Hard to control
     multiple versions?
<li> Need for a tool to check for SIDS-compliance
<li> Parallel implementation needed
<li> May need better definition for chemistry - Mori Mani may eventually
     help to define extensions as he delves deeper into it
<li> Need for a move to HDF 5 as the binary representation
<li> Need to keep existing users engaged - need more CFD codes to
     implement and actively use CGNS
</ul>

<b>Summary of Action Items</b> -

<ol>
<li> Chris to initiate discussion for feedback on HDF 5, with Powers,
     Edwards, Michal, Cosner, Bush, and Poinot.
<li> Chris to initiate team to evaluate Part 52 with Bussoletti,
     Poirier, Michal, Bush, and Cosner, to make sure it conforms (maps)
     to the latest SIDS document.
<li> Bruce to complete documentation of adfviewer and its new tools.
     Charlie to put this documentation on the web site, when Bruce
     finishes it.
<li> Bruce to look into SourceForge as a possible alternative to
     distributing CGNS software.
</ol>
