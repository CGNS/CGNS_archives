<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Telecon Minutes</h2>

10 September 2008

<p>
<ol>
<li> The meeting was called to order at 11:00 AM eastern time. There were
     <a href="#attendees">9 attendees</a>, listed below.
<p>
<li> The minutes of the <a href="telecon_jul08.html">2 July 2008
     meeting</a> were approved as posted on the web site.
<p>
<li> Discussion of HDF-5 array ordering
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Summary of problem:  HDF-5 uses C-index ordering for its
          arrays, but CGNS uses Fortran indexing.  So if anyone (in
          Version 2.5 or earlier) wrote an HDF-5 file with CGNS, it
          would have its indexing incorrect.  This did not hurt if
          one only used CGNS API to read/write the file (i.e. it was
          internally consistent), but it would be incorrect if one tried
          to use other software to read the HDF-5 CGNS file.  Also,
          partial read/writes in the CGNS software did not work.
     <li> Wedan fixed this for Version 3.  He added new "HDF5 Version"
          node.  If detected, then the software knows the indexing
          is already correct.  If not detected, then the software
          automatically corrects the faulty indexing.
     <li> <u>Poinot to try Version 3 fix for HDF-5 indexing problem, and
          make sure it works for his applications.</u>
     <li> There was also discussion about whether to put the fix in
          Version 2.x.  If we do, we lose forward compatability (if
          try to open new file with older software, it will fail).
          Consensus: to NOT put fix in Version 2.x.  This means that
          Version 2.x and earlier will have this known problem: HDF-5
          indexing is backward.  We should recommend that only V3 and
          above be used in conjunction with HDF-5.
     <li> <u>Rumsey to add disclaimer about HDF-5 incorrect index ordering
          in Version 2.x to website.</u>
     <li> <u>Towne to add disclaimer about HDF-5 incorrect index ordering
          in Version 2.x in MLL documentation.</u>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Other discussion related to HDF-5
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Poinot tested HDF-5 1st level compression.  Works well, but
          very slow.  Easy to put in MLL - only 5-10 lines of code.
          Uses "chunk" storage.  Chunk feature has a "magic" value that
          sets size of the chunk.
     <li> We need to decide how to put compression in at the API level.
     <li> Consensus was that <tt>cg_configure</tt> would be an
          appropriate place to bring this capability in.  Can make it
          so it only compresses when greater than a certain number of
          bytes.
     <li> <u>Poinot to send Wedan his coding and other information related
          to HDF-5 compression.</u>
     <li> <u>Wedan to incorporate compression capability into Version 3
          MLL.</u>
     <li> Hauser asked if there are any changes needed in SIDS-to-HDF5
          document?
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Added this to "to-do" list for HDF-5 switchover
               (attachment 2)
          </ol>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Status of previous action items
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Wedan and Hauser to look into improving documentation and
          build instructions for V3.0.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Not done yet - <u>action carries.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Rumsey to e-mail committee to remind them to comment on new
          extensions.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Done: mail sent to all CGNSTalk, but no responses
               received.  <u>Rumsey to email committee and ask for vote on
               two existing proposals and collect responses.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Hauser to remove instructions regarding XML output from
          configure script in V3.0.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Not done yet - <u>action carries.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Hauser to make HDF-5 part of V3.0's tar file distribution, and
          set up makefile appropriately.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Not done yet - <u>action carries.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Hauser to contact vendors regarding testing V3.0 prior to
          release if possible and report back to committee.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Almost ready for V3 release. Action deleted.
          </ol>
     <li> Hauser will add HDF-5 parallel code to SourceForge and will
          let users know when it is available.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Tabled until after Version 3 release - <u>action carries.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Rumsey to email Towne and Wedan about the issue of node
          ordering for <tt>NGON_n</tt>.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Done.  There was a lot of discussion on the outcome of
               this.
          <li> One issue: if one uses <tt>NGON + NFACE</tt> to describe
               arbitrary polyhedra, you need additional "winding"
               information. As pointed out in email by Feldman, this
               can be done by making <tt>NFACE</tt> + or &minus; (+ indicates
               pointing outward from the cell matching the <tt>NGON</tt>
               right hand rule definition, and &minus; pointing inward).  You
               also need to prohibit faces that are not attached to a
               volume element - other than at boundaries.
          <li> Second issue: the draft documentation currently
               allows TWO methods: <tt>NGON + NFACE</tt>, and also
               <tt>NGON</tt> + parent data.  Having two methods is
               confusing, and can put too big a burden on external
               software readers.  Allmaras pointed out that his original
               proposal a long time ago involved use of parent data, but
               the group had decided to go with <tt>NGON + NFACE</tt>
               because it was already coded and it did not involve
               additional descriptive nodes.  In today's discussion,
               consensus was to only document the <tt>NGON + NFACE</tt>
               method (including <tt>NFACE</tt> + or &minus; for winding
               information).
          <li> <u>Towne to modify <tt>NGON+NFACE</tt> documentation for
               V3 to include Feldman's suggestions, and to remove
               <tt>NGON</tt> + parent data as an option.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Paul, Bussoletti, and Allmaras to continue to look into
          finding manpower development (particularly for MLL
          implementation) resources at Boeing.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Ongoing. Seeds have been planted.  <u>Action carries.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Duque and Hauser to continue to develop proposal for handling
          sprays of unconnected points.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Not done yet - <u>action carries.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Rumsey to look at posting a specific checklist on the website
          on what to put in a proposal for extension.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Done.
          </ol>
     <li> Duque and Hauser to continue to pursue NSF funding and look
          into idea of a fundraising collaborative.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Not done yet - <u>action carries.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Rumsey will contact EUCASS 2009 conference organizers about
          possibility of having CGNS sessions and/or tutorial.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Done.  They are interested.  Conference is in June 2009
               in Versailles, France. They are looking into providing
               a room for CGNS's use for 1-2 days.  We can perhaps
               hold a tutorial session and a series of talks or panel
               discussions, much like we did in San Francisco in
               2006. Poinot has become our new point-of-contact for
               this.
          <li> <u>Poinot to forward a draft proposal on CGNS activities for
               EUCASS to Hauser &amp; Rumsey that will eventually go to the
               EUCASS organizers.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Hauser and Rumsey to consider writing abstract on CGNS
          progress for AIAA summer 2009 conference.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> This conference would conflict with EUCASS, so action
               cancelled.
          </ol>
     <li> Hauser to merge Poinot's changes related to HDF-5 linking into
          V3.0.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Done.  Currently in CVS.
          </ol>
     <li> Hauser to look into methods on SourceForge for getting Poinot
          developer access: switch from CVS to SVN? or use SSL?
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Done.  Poinot now has check-out access.  Cannot currently
               check-in because of ONERA's firewall.
          </ol>
     <li> Hauser to speak to Koziol at HDF-5 Group about issues related
          to developers and funding.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Done.  HDF-5 has become some sort of non-profit.  They
               have about 20 employees, and have long-term support.
               They are willing to help us look into taking the same
               route, and they are also willing to collaborate.
          <li> Wedan mentioned the "donate" button on SourceForge, if we
               have a place to put the money.
          <li> Rumsey asked about accounting and tax-filing issues (and
               who would do it) if we tried to go the non-profit route.
          <li> <u>Hauser to attend an upcoming HDF-5 meeting in Colorado,
               and find out more about what it means to become a
               non-profit like HDF-5 and how it would affect things.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Wedan to investigate issue of MLL deleting the entire node
          even though its new dimensions are the same.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Not done yet.  May be good idea for certain nodes.
               <u>Action carries.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Hauser will take control of <i>cgns.org</i> domain name and
          will consider possibility of moving website to Utah State site.
          <ol type=i>
          <li> Not done yet - <u>action carries.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Hauser to contact Hunten about ISO/STEP and ask the best way
          for us to comment.
