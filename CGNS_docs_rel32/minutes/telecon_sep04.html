          <li> suggestion to further advertise by handing out CGNS
               material at AIAA meeting in exhibit hall - <u>Rumsey and
               Edwards will look into this</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Rumsey to check with Towne regarding posting documentation to
          SourceForge.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> done, discussion below
          </ul>
     <li> Rumsey to discuss (during this telecon) the possibility of
          holding a CGNS User's meeting in summer 2005, in conjunction with
          the AIAA meeting.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> done, discussion below
          </ul>
     <li> Rumsey to discuss (during this telecon) the possible date of
          summer 2005 as a goal for switching over to HDF-5.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> done, discussion below
          </ul>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Status of open items from prior meetings
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> It is not yet known whether issue of links causing slowdown in
          files with thousands of blocks will be as big a problem with
          HDF-5.  See 7a. 
     </ol>
<p>
<li> ISO status/discussion (Cosner, in absentia):
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Boeing does not appear willing to resume funding of AP 237
          soon (no funding since 1/1/03).
     <li> At time of cancellation, fluid dynamics standard was 80-90%
          complete.
     <li> The ISO-STEP category of "Engineering Analysis Data" (for
          which AP 237 was one component) is led by Keith Hunter
          of Lockheed-Martin, Ft. Worth TX.  He plans to integrate
          fluid dynamics standard with the existing AP 209 standard
          for finite-element solid mechanics (many underlying data
          structures are functionally the same).  It is expected that
          the CFD-related structures derived from CGNS will be preserved
          in the process.
     <li> This go-forward plan is based on the assumption that Boeing
          will not resume participation in this effort. (Note: Cosner
          is now in a new position in Boeing, so even if Boeing funding
          is restored, he will not be able to participate, except in
          initial stages of re-launching the Boeing engagement.)
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Documentation issues and CGNStalk issues (Towne):
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Discussion of putting documentation on SourceForge or not
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> Towne creates and posts both PDF and HTML - may lose this
               generality if post to SourceForge (it is not straightforward
               to do both automatically)
          <li> After discussion, decided that <u>Towne will post LaTeX
               documents on website</u>.  Anyone interested in modifying the
               documentation can download these and pass back to Towne, who
               will create new PDF and HTML.
          <li> Decision also made to put old versions of documentation
               on SourceForge in tar files along with old versions of
               CGNS software.  <u>Towne will send Wedan old versions of
               documentation.  Wedan will also look for version 1.x
               documentation and will post on Sourceforge along with that
               software.</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Status of V2.3 becoming revised AIAA recommended practice
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> AIAA has put the SIDS out for public comment - <u>Towne will
               e-mail Craig Day at AIAA to find out status.</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Is there a need to add &amp; define "<tt>SoundIntensityDB</tt>"
          and others from acoustics as a data name identifier?
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> <u>Rumsey will e-mail Bussoletti to ask him for definitions,
               if he would like them implemented.</u> It should be easy to
               implement, because it is simply a definition in the SIDS.
          </ul>
     <li> Rumsey asked about hitting "reply" when answering a CGNSTalk
          e-mail.  By default the reply goes to sender only and not
          CGNSTalk. <u>Towne will check to see if the settings can be
          changed so replys automatically go to CGNSTalk.</u>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Software status/discussion (Wedan):
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Status of slowdown when writing files with thousands of
          blocks, using links
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> question as to whether this will still be a major issue
               for HDF-5
          <li> <u>Van der Weide will try out the HDF-5 version of CGNS on
               his test case, using links, and will report back</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Need for <tt>cg_axisym_query</tt> call?
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> there was an error that has been fixed, so there should
               no longer be a problem with this using existing calls
          <li> this and many other small bug fixes have been made -
               <u>Wedan will make another 2.3.x release and will announce it
               soon</u>
          </ul>
     <li> Can we have API sort BCs and Connectivity alphanumerically
          (like Zones)?
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> a lot of discussion on this; if everything done
               alphanumerically, it will help with regard to HDF-5 (make it
               more efficient), but if a user is expecting creation order,
               then there would be problems
          <li> most participants in the discussion seemed to feel that
               doing alphanumeric sorting would be desirable, but no firm
               decision made yet (this will be added to list of open items)
          </ul>
     <li> Wedan mentioned that the CGNS check routine now checks <em>all</em>
          syntax for V2.3.
     </ol>
<p>
<li> HDF-5 status/discussion (Hauser, Poinot):
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Held discussion on possible official switchover date to
          HDF-5 in Summer 2005. It was felt that a Beta version (including
          documentation) should be released at least 6 months prior to the
          switchover date.
     <li> In looking at the <a href="#HDF5_todo">"to-do" list</a>, many people
          felt that the entire list wasn't really <em>necessary</em>
          to complete prior to beta release.  In other words, many
          of the items could be done later.  Thus, January 2005 may
          even be a realistic date for releasing and announcing a Beta
          version. We would need to decide for sure on this issue by the
          next telecon.
     <li> Three key items on the "to do" list seem to be:
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> completing the documentation (especially SIDS-to-HDF5
               mapping document) - <u>Poinot agreed to work on this</u>
          <li> deciding how to perform automatic (or not) updating
               of ADF-type CGNS files to HDF5-type; this is important for
               backward compatibility, since many users would want the
               conversion to occur automatically and transparently, but it
               was also discussed that some users might want to preserve the
               old ADF-type file as is - we need to give more thought to
               this, and discuss again at the next telecon
          <li> issue of creation order
          </ul>
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Extensions status/discussion (Edwards):
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Intelligent Light (IL) is completing 6 extensions, as part of
          their SBIR.
          <ul type=disc>
          <li> EM part still needs testing - <u>Michal will check with
               other Boeing people to see if they can do this soon</u>
          <li> There are still some minor issues with partial
               read/write: <u>Wall will look into possibility of filling in
               unwritten portions of array with NaN's (will this work on
               multiple platforms?)</u>
          <li> There is also a minor fix needed (add
               <tt>EMConductivityModel</tt>)
          </ul>
     <li> The extensions will eventually be implemented as Version 2.4
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Other issues:
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Need for developing certification process was not discussed,
          but remains an issue.  This will be added to list of open items.
     <li> Discussion of holding a possible "CGNS User's meeting" was
          tabled; it is subject to decision on release date of V3.0.
     <li> Poinot's CGNS compiler is not ready for release yet, but
          should be finished by January 2005 in time for his paper
          presentation at the AIAA meeting in Reno.
     <li> Rumsey mentioned that his 2-year term as chairperson will
          expire in January 2005.  At that time (Reno meeting) we need to
          hold a chairperson election. Anyone interested in filling this
          position should contact Rumsey or Bush. Primary responsibilities
          include (1) organizing and leading regular telecons and meetings,
          (2) processing the minutes, (3) helping to lead and keep track
          of the various activities and directions of the CGNS effort, and
          (4) working to promote CGNS and give it greater visibility. The
          chairperson should be able to attend one face-to-face CGNS meeting
          per year (typically this has been the AIAA meeting in Reno). Also,
          it is helpful for the chairperson to maintain contact with the
          AIAA's CoS (Committee on Standards), which is our "parent"
          committee. The CoS also holds meetings at AIAA conferences.
     <li> Next telecon will be sometime in November 2004.
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Meeting was adjourned at 12:30 PM.
<p>
<li> Summary of <b><u>action items</u></b>:
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Wedan will formally archive old versions of software, along
          with corresponding documentation (including 1.x versions if they
          can be found), on SourceForge.
     <li> Van der Weide will look for examples of CGNS read/write
          programs, and will send to Wedan for posting.
     <li> Hauser will continue to check into parallel issues regarding
          time-dependent data.
     <li> Rumsey and Edwards to look into possibility to advertise CGNS
          by handing out CGNS material at AIAA meeting in exhibit hall.
     <li> Towne will post LaTeX documents on documentation website.
     <li> Towne will send Wedan old versions of documentation for
          posting on SourceForge.
     <li> Towne will e-mail Craig Day at AIAA to find out status of
          latest SIDS as AIAA recommended practice document.
     <li> Rumsey will e-mail Bussoletti to ask him for definitions of
          <tt>SoundIntensityDB</tt>, etc.
     <li> Towne will check to see if the settings in CGNSTalk can be
          changed so replys automatically go to CGNSTalk.
     <li> Van der Weide will try out the HDF-5 version of CGNS on his
          test case, using links, and will report back.
     <li> Wedan will make another 2.3.x release and will announce it
          soon.
     <li> Poinot will work on completing SIDS-to-HDF5 documentation, in
          preparation for the Beta release of V3.0.
     <li> Michal will check with other Boeing people to see if they can
          test EM extension soon.
     <li> Wall will look into possibility of filling in unwritten
          portions of array with NaN's for partial read/write extension, and
          will work with Wedan to prepare all extensions for release.
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Summary of <b><u>open items</u></b> from prior meetings (these are different from
     action items, in that they are open or unresolved issues that we
     want to keep track of, but there are no specific actions required
     of anyone at this point in time):
     <p>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Issue of links causing slowdown (perhaps can modify open call
          so it does not follow links).
     <li> With next major release, eliminate the
          <tt>Pointlist/Range</tt> + <tt>CellCenter</tt> possibility
          (and thus remove the need for <tt>GridLocation</tt> under
          <tt>BC_t</tt>).  Next major release of API will need to
          automatically make the alteration (transparent to the
          user). Documentation (SIDS, User's Guide, other?) will need to
          be changed.
     <li> Resolve <a href="#HDF5_todo">HDF-5 "to-do" list</a>.
     <li> Issue of 8 units - need consistency between <tt>DimensionalUnits</tt>
          and <tt>DimensionalExponents</tt>.
     <li> Eventually resolve any differences between SIDS and ISO/STEP.
     <li> Question of need (or preference) to have alphanumeric sorting
          of everything (like is currently done for zones)
     <li> Need for developing certification process (official test for
          compliance)
     </ol>

<a name="HDF5_todo"></a>
<h2>Tentative to-do list prior to HDF-5 switchover</h2>

<ul>
<li> Complete and test parallel implementation
<li> Complete and test API capability to automatically detect and switch
     between ADF and HDF-5 (transparent to user?)
<li> Assess/minimize impact on software vendors using CGNS
<li> Make changes recommended by HDF-5 to improve usability with HDF-5
     (e.g., character strings as opposed to character arrays)
<li> HDF-5 must fix "creation tracking"
<li> Assess compression capability of HDF-5
<li> Create SIDS-to-HDF-5 documentation (Poinot?)
<li> CGNS configure scripts will need to be modified to check for
     availability of appropriate HDF-5 libraries.
<li> Possibly add flag-based options when opening CGNS files.  For
     example: "follow links" vs. "don't follow links"; "use ADF" vs. "use
     HDF-5"; "translate file automatically" vs. "leave the file as-is";
     "compress" vs. "don't compress".
<li> Look into eliminating need for ID's from MLL
