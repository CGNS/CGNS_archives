<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Telecon Minutes</h2>

20 March 2003<br>
11:00 AM Eastern Time<br><br>

<ol>
<li> The meeting was called to order at 11:05 AM.
     There were <a href="#attendees">12 attendees</a>, listed below.
<br><br>
<li> The minutes of the 6 January 2003 Reno meeting were reviewed and
     approved as posted on the web site.
<br><br>
<li> Status of Reno action items:<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> HDF-5: Everyone agrees it is a good idea to eventually
          replace ADF with HDF-5.  HDF-5 has the following advantages:
          it has large following and support, it possesses parallel
          capabilities, and it has strong possibility to becoming an
          accepted ISO standard.  The two major issues for us are
          backward compatibility and doing the work itself.  Marc
          Poinot has a prototype available now (off the PyCGNS website
          <a href="http://elsa.onera.fr/CGNS/releases/">&lt;http://elsa.onera.fr/CGNS/releases/&gt;</a>
          <img src="../external.png" alt="external link">),
          but it needs a lot of testing and has some limitations (like
          missing system services such as error management).  Ignoring
          links, Marc estimates it might take approximately 1 month to
          complete work on it, but he personally doesn't have the time
          to do it now.  Bruce Wedan and Chris Rumsey agreed to take a
          look at the prototype as it currently stands.
     <li> Part 52: Nothing done.  The ISO effort currently on standby
          within Boeing.  An evaluation of the ISO parts by the CGNS
          committee will also require active participation from at
          least one of the Boeing people who is working with the STEP
          documents.
     <li> ADFVIEWER documentation and SourceForge:  The documentation is
          complete and is on SourceForge, but there are currently still
          some wrinkles to work out with SourceForge to make it work
          for anonymous users.  Bruce Wedan will send the documentation
          separately to Charlie Towne.  Bruce will also give information
          to Chris Rumsey so he can try accessing CGNS from SourceForge.
          For SourceForge, copyright is not an issue - we are protected.
          The software continues to be under the GNU lesser public
          license.  Once CGNS is accessible through SourceForge, the
          current plan is that Bruce (and perhaps one other person
          outside of ICEM?) will control and grant write privileges to
          certain people.  Bruce also is developing shell scripts that
          run through the mid-level-library test cases.
     </ol>
<br>
<li> ISO Status - Ray Cosner reported that there was a problem with the
     2003 budget for ISO at Boeing that has resulted in the project
     currently being put on hold.  Thus there was no progress at the
     last ISO meeting in early March.  The budget problem should
     hopefully be resolved soon.  There is a STEP meeting next week, and
     another ISO meeting in June.
<br><br>
<li> Documentation - Charlie Towne will put in the
     <a href="#sids_mods">changes (clarifications) suggested by
     Chris</a> in the BC section of the SIDS, shown below.  Also,
     Charlie says the documentation for utilities is currently buried
     (difficult to find / get to).  He will correct this.
<br><br>
<li> Discussion on extensions:<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> There appears to be a need for allowing <tt>GridLocation</tt>
          and <tt>PointRange</tt>/<tt>PointList</tt> under
          <tt>UserDefinedData_t</tt>.  Chris will write up a proposal
          for extension and have Bruce post it.  There has also arisen
          a proposal from Florent Cayre of SNECMA in France, regarding
          additional specification of GridLocation for data deep under
          <tt>BC_t</tt>.  Chris also agreed to write up this proposal
          and pass it on to Bruce to post.
     <li> Regarding tools to check for SIDS compliance, there are now
          two separate tools in process of being developed.  One (by
          Marc Poinot) is in conjunction with PyCGNS and performs all
          parts of a compliance check (syntactic and semantic parts).
          Checking a CGNS file is a compiler-like tool, and a compiler
          has a syntactic part that can be done using XML.  The second
          tool (by Bruce Wedan) checks physical data, and can be used in
          conjunction with adfviewer.
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Software Status:  Version 2.2 is ready to come off Beta status.
     Bruce will remove the Beta status as soon as SourceForge is working
     for CGNS.  In the future, CGNS will be obtainable only from
     SourceForge, and no longer from the ICEM website (the ICEM cite
     will point to SourceForge).  As soon as the beta status is removed,
     Bruce will notify Charlie so Charlie can revise the documentation.
<br><br>
<li> Other issues:<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Greg Stuckert mentioned a colleague with questions regarding
          CGNS's capability to handle material properties and different
          equations of state.  Bob Bush said he believed that the SIDS
          currently handles these, but also recommended that the person
          submit a detailed question to cgnstalk, so that someone could
          more properly respond and point to where in the SIDS it is
          covered.
     <li> Charlie Towne will look into capability for archiving of
          cgnstalk questions and responses.
     <li> Marc Poinot reported on a recent meeting of the French CGNS
          User's group.  Many large companies met.  Each has its own way
          of using the standard.  Mostly, CGNS is currently used for its
          intellectual content (SIDS part).
     <li> The possibility of doing an AIAA paper for Reno 2004 was
          discussed. Marc Poinot and Chris Rumsey agreed to think about
          it, and perhaps submit something together if possible.
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Next Telecon will probably be in mid-May.  There will likely also
     be a CGNS meeting at the summer AIAA Meeting in Orlando.  Craig Day
     is the person to contact for reserving a room, which should not
     conflict with the Standards committee meeting (Tom Shih).
<br><br>
<li> Meeting was adjourned at 12:15 PM.
<br><br>
<li> Summary of action items:<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Bruce Wedan and Chris Rumsey to check out Poinot's HDF-5
          prototype.
     <li> Bruce Wedan to send adfviewer documentation to Charlie Towne.
     <li> Bruce Wedan to send SourceForge info to Chris Rumsey so Chris
          can try to access CGNS from it.
     <li> Charlie Towne to make <a href="#sids_mods">changes to SIDS</a>.
     <li> Charlie Towne to improve accessibility of utility
          documentation.
     <li> Chris Rumsey to write 2 proposals for extensions:
          additional capability for <tt>UserDefinedData</tt>, and
          <tt>GridLocation</tt> deep under <tt>BC_t</tt> and have them
          posted.
     <li> Bruce Wedan to get CGNS up and working on SourceForge - and
          notify Charlie Towne when it is ready so he can update the
          documentation (beta status will come off at the same time).
     <li> Charlie Towne to look into archiving cgnstalk questions and
          responses.
     <li> Chris Rumsey and Marc Poinot to discuss offline the
          possibility for a Reno 2004 CGNS paper.
     <li> Chris Rumsey to arrange for CGNS meeting room in Orlando.

<h2>Proposed changes/additions to SIDS</h2>

<ol>
<li> Re-wording of <a href="../sids/bc.html#ZoneBC">Sect 9.2</a> in SIDS
     after notes:<br><br>

     OLD:<br>
     Boundary-condition information for a single patch is contained in the
     <tt>BC_t</tt> structure.
     All boundary-condition information pertaining to a given zone is
     contained in the list of <tt>BC_t</tt> structure entities.
     If a zone contains <i>N</i> boundary-condition patches, then <i>N</i>
     separate instances of <tt>BC_t</tt> must be provided in the
     <tt>ZoneBC_t</tt> entity for the zone.
<br><br>
     NEW:<br>
     Boundary-condition information for a single patch is contained in the
     <tt>BC_t</tt> structure.
     All boundary-condition information pertaining to a given zone is
     contained in the list of <tt>BC_t</tt> structure entities.
     If a zone contains <i>N</i> boundary-condition patches, then <i>N</i>
     <FONT color="#009900">(and only <i>N</i>)</FONT> separate instances
     of <tt>BC_t</tt> must be provided in the <tt>ZoneBC_t</tt> entity
     for the zone.
     <FONT color="#009900">That is, each boundary-condition patch must
     be represented by a single <tt>BC_t</tt> entity.</FONT>
<br><br>
<li> Expansion of <a href="../sids/bc.html#BC">Sect. 9.3</a> (on
     <tt>BC_t</tt>), note 2 in SIDS:<br><br>

     OLD:<br>
     When <tt>GridLocation</tt> is set to <tt>Vertex</tt>, then
     <tt>PointList</tt> or <tt>PointRange</tt> refer to node indices,
     for both structured and unstructured grids.
     When <tt>GridLocation</tt> is set to <tt>FaceCenter</tt> ... etc...
<br><br>
     NEW:<br>
     When <tt>GridLocation</tt> is set to <tt>Vertex</tt>, then
     <tt>PointList</tt> or <tt>PointRange</tt> refer to node indices,
     for both structured and unstructured grids.
     <FONT color="#009900">These node indices define the BC patch.
     In particular, it should
     be noted that these points can be interpreted in one of two ways:
     the finite-difference sense and the finite-volume sense.  In the
     finite-difference sense, the points are defined as specific point
     locations at which the BC patch is enforced.  In the finite-volume
     sense, the points define the boundary surrounding the BC patch
     region; thus, the indices are used to define the logical region
     in index-space within which the particular BC patch is defined.
     This latter case means that the edges of the BC patches may be
     multiply-defined, but the areas which are enclosed are unique.
     There is no mechanism currently included in this standard to
     differentiate between these two interpretations.  Both are allowed.</FONT>
     When <tt>GridLocation</tt> is set to <tt>FaceCenter</tt> ... etc...
