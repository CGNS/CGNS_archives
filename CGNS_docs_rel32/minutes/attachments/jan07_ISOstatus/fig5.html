<p>
This is page 2 (of 2) of a chart illustrating the AP209 E2 high level
planning model.
It's divided into two areas, labeled "Composite Structure Definition,
Specification, and Shape" and "Analysis Model, Control, and Results".

<p>
In the "Composite Structure Definition, Specification, and Shape" area
are three boxes, with the following labels and contents.
<ul>
<li> Composite Structure Definition
     <ul>
     <li> Composite_material_aspects
     <li> Part_and_zone_laminate_tables
     <li> Ply_orientation_specification
     </ul>
<li> Composite Structure Shape
     <ul>
     <li> Composite_constituent_shape
     </ul>
<li> Material
     <ul>
     <li> Material_specification
     <li> Material_property
     <li> Stock_material
     <li> Design_material_aspects

</ul>

<p>
The "Material" box is connected to the following boxes.
<ul>
<li> Composite Structure Definition

<li> Fields and Properties (in the "Analysis Model, Control, and
     Results" area)
<li> Document Management (on <a href="fig4.html">page 1</a>)
<li> Product Identification (on <a href="fig4.html">page 1</a>)
<li> Geometric Shape (on <a href="fig4.html">page 1</a>)
</ul>

<p>
In the "Analysis Model, Control, and Results" area are five boxes, with
the following labels and contents.
<ul>
<li> Analysis Identification
     <ul>

     <li> CFD_equations
     <li> CFD_results
     <li> Finite_element_analysis
     <li> Mesh_function
     </ul>
</ul>

<p>
The "Analysis Identification" box is connected to the following boxes.
<ul>
<li> Product Identification (on <a href="fig4.html">page 1</a>)
<li> Analysis Model
</ul>
