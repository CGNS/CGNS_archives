<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Meeting Minutes</h2>

14 January 2002<br>
7:00pm<br>
Reno, Nevada

<p>
The meeting was called to order at 7:00pm.
There were 24 attendees, as <a href="#attendees">listed below</a>.

<ul>
<li> <b>Charter/Membership</b> - 
     A motion to amend the Charter to increase the number of voting members
     of the Steering committee from 16 to 17 was made, seconded and passed by
     consensus.  A motion to amend the Charter by adding ONERA as an official
     Steering Committee member was made, seconded and passed by consensus.

     <p>
     Laurent Cambier introduced the ONERA efforts with CGNS (for Marc
     Poinot).
<br><br>
<li> <b>ISO Status</b> - 
     Ray Cosner presented an overview of the ISO status
     (<a href="attachments/jan02_ISO.html">HTML</a>,
     <a href="attachments/jan02_ISO.pdf">PDF</a>).  Ray also solicited
     interest in a 2 day ISO-CGNS workshop at which the CGNS Steering
     Committee would do a thorough review of the ISO documentation.
     This would probably occur in the late spring time frame.  Many in
     the audience indicated a willingness to attend, so Ray will set a
     date and location with Bob Bush and invitations will be sent to
     interested parties.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Documentation</b> - 
     Theresa Benyo gave an overview of the documentation status
     (<a href="attachments/jan02_documentation.html">HTML</a>,
     <a href="attachments/jan02_documentation.pdf">PDF</a>) for Charlie
     Towne.
     
     <p>
     Jim French indicated that the transfer of the SIDS documentation to
     AIAA for transition to an AIAA Recommended Practice is underway.  Final
     documentation should be available soon.  This will be distributed to
     the entire CGNS mailing list, and votes for approval solicited from the
     official Steering Committee members.  We anticipate this will occur in
     the spring.
     
     <p>
     David Edwards reported that the AIAA Paper was completed, and presented
     the paper on Wednesday.  The paper was well received.  Thanks to David
     for pulling it together so nicely.
     
     <p>
     It was mentioned that CGNStalk has had little activity lately.  Theresa
     will ask Charlie to check to be sure it is operational.  All interested
     parties are encouraged to submit questions and comments via this web
     vehicle.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Extensions</b> - 
     Chris Rumsey gave an overview of the status of various extensions
     (<a href="attachments/jan02_extensions.html">HTML</a>,
     <a href="attachments/jan02_extensions.pdf">PDF</a>).
     
     <p>
     Diane Poirier gave an overview of the version control system that is in
     place to facilitate software updates and code management.  The system is
     based on CVS and is currently controlled via controlled access.  Access
     can be granted by the Steering Committee.  Currently, only Diane (ICEM)
     and David Edwards (Intelligent Light) have access.  It is intended that
     others will be provided access when the need arises.  It was noted that
     we should have a document itemizing the quality control steps needed to
     maintain the software integrity.  This may be in the form of a checklist
     that includes the update steps, and include a process to have updated
     code checked by a third party before insertion in the official version.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Related Software</b> - 
     Bob Bush gave a brief overview of material Marc Poinot prepared
     (<a href="attachments/jan02_PyCGNS-intro.html">HTML</a>,
     <a href="attachments/jan02_PyCGNS-intro.pdf">PDF</a>) that details
     the PyCGNS software that ONERA has developed.
     The software is available from
     <a href="http://elsa.onera.fr/CGNS/releases"><i>http://elsa.onera.fr/CGNS/releases</i></a>
     <img src="../external.png" alt="external link">.
     
     <p>
     There was quick mention of the C++ interface being developed by Manuel
     Kessler and Udo Tremel.  Unfortunately they were not able to attend
     the meeting, so the discussion was relatively generic.  There was
     also discussion of how to make this software available and how the
     CGNS Steering Committee should support the software.  We would like
     to suggest that rather than posting the library directly on the CGNS
     web site, that we provide a summary of the capability and a link to
     a developers web site.  This would allow the developers to respond
     directly to questions, comments and extensions without introducing an
     intermediate filter, and it would lessen the need for the Steering
     Committee to support unfamiliar software.  However, it will also
     increase the support burden on the developers.  We will work with Udo
     and Manuel to determine the most effective means of distributing the
     software.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Issues</b> - 
     There was a short discussion on funding and support.  It was suggested
     that funding agencies be identified, and proposals prepared.  One
     approach would be to have interested organizations bid on tasks directly
     to funding agencies.  The role of the Steering Committee could be to
     coordinate and endorse various proposals instead of trying to bid
     directly.
     
     <p>
     NIST was suggested as a potentially interested funding agency.  Ray
     Cosner offered that Cary Presser of NIST often attends the CoS meetings.
     (Bob Bush met with Cary briefly after the CoS meeting Wednesday evening.
     Cary indicated that NIST is not generally a funding agency, but he has
     interest in CGNS and will assist us in looking for potential funding.)
</ul>

<p>
The meeting was adjourned at about 8:30.
