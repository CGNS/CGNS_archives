<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Telecon Minutes</h2>

29 May 2003<br>
11:00 AM Eastern Time<br><br>

<ol>
<li> The meeting was called to order at 11:05 AM.
     There were <a href="#attendees">11 attendees</a>, listed below.
<br><br>
<li> The minutes of the <a href="telecon_mar03.html">20 March 2003
     telecon meeting</a> were reviewed and approved as posted on the web
     site.
<br><br>
<li> Status of previous action items:<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Poinot's HDF-5 implementation:  Wedan &amp; Rumsey both
          checked it out and tried the test case, but nothing done
          beyond that.  <u>Power said they are currently looking into it
          as a part of CHSSI project, and will report to the group when
          they get further along.</u>
     <li> <a href="../cgnstools/adfviewer/index.html">ADFVIEWER
          documentation</a>:  Wedan has completed - it comes with the
          package, through SourceForge. Towne has also put documentation
          separately on the web documentation page.  ADFVIEWER also
          now has "CGNS compatibility" button functional, for limited
          checking of file for compatibility with the standard.
     <li> SourceForge status: up and running and working fine.  Wedan
          and Rumsey are administrators, Poinot is currently the only
          developer.  Access is available by downloading tar files or
          by accessing via CVS (see (g) below for further discussion).
          Need SSH to use CVS.
     <li> Rewording of BC section in SIDS:  Towne has completed.
     <li> Accessibility of <a href="../cgnstools/index.html">tools and
          utilities documentation</a>:  Towne has revamped so that
          documentation is now accessible through 1 link as opposed to
          being difficult to navigate to.
     <li> New proposals for extension:
          Rumsey has posted on CGNS website - <u>reviews
          and comments needed by August.</u>
     <li> Removal of beta status: done, as of initiation of
          SourceForge
          accessibility
          (by Wedan) Version 2.2 is now the latest
          official CGNS release.
          <ol type="i">
          <li> Issue: if get tar file, you get latest "official"
               release, if download using CVS, you get official + bug
               fixes.
          <li> We will recommend that users get the "official" release;
               CVS version is unofficial.
          <li> When enough fixes accumulate, or when a "major" bug is
               corrected, then there should be a new "official" release
               issued.
          <li> Developers should "tag" any significant series of changes
               that are committed.
          <li> <u>Wedan will add comment(s) on web page and/or on
               SourceForge regarding this policy.</u>
          </ol>
     <li> Archiving CGNSTALK:  Towne completed this.
     <li> Reno 2004 paper:  Poinot, Rumsey, Bush submitted abstract
          "Impact of CGNS on CFD Workflow".
     <li> Orlando meeting:  Rumsey set up for Tues, June 24 at 7PM in
          Jasmine room.
     </ol>
<br>
<li> ISO Status - Ray Cosner (via e-mail) reported that there was still
     a problem with the 2003 budget for ISO at Boeing. It is a long shot
     to get restored funding this year; it is more likely that budgets
     will be restored in 2004.  Some limited efforts have continued in
     Seattle, but the funding has been week-to-week and it is likely to
     stop soon.  In spite of the budget problem, they still may get to
     present the Committee Draft Proposal (via e-mail) for all 4 parts
     in June at the ISO-STEP meeting in Stuttgart.
<br><br>
<li> Documentation - Towne asked if we want to submit the latest (2.2)
     <a href="../sids/index.html">SIDS documentation</a> to AIAA for a
     revised <a href="../aiaa.html">recommended practice guideline</a>.
     The answer is yes, although there may be a minor modification to
     make first regarding the
     <a href="../filemap/nodes.html#CGNSLibraryVersion"><tt>CGNSLibraryVersion</tt>
     node</a> (see item (7b) below).  <u>After that issue is resolved,
     Towne will proceed with forwarding the latest documentation to
     AIAA.</u> The spam problem we were having with the cgnstalk mailing
     list seems to have died down, so a decision on how to deal with the
     problem was tabled for now.
<br><br>
<li> Software status - Wedan mentioned that recent bug (a check testing
     index range in pnts) was fixed in the official release of 2.2: the
     check was taken out (so it is possible for a user to end up with
     invalid point ranges - the software does not check for it).  This
     bug is a result of a change made at the release of version 2.0 for
     unstructured grids, having to do with element list and element
     range being taken out.  Wedan asked details about the change made,
     but those present could not remember enough.  <u>Wedan will speak to
     Poirier to get more details on why it was taken out and whether or
     not it is possible or practical to put back in.</u>
<br><br>
<li> Discussion on extensions:<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Regarding a need for allowing <tt>GridLocation</tt>
          and <tt>PointRange</tt>/<tt>PointList</tt> under
          <tt>UserDefinedData_t</tt>, and also regarding additional
          specification of <tt>GridLocation</tt> for data deep under
          <tt>BC_t</tt>: these proposals have been posted on the CGNS
          website under Proposals
          For Extension.
          <u>Deadline is 30 Aug 2003 for comments (Bush
          volunteered as one reviewer, more are needed).</u>
     <li> It has come up on cgnstalk: the need to make
          <a href="../filemap/nodes.html#CGNSLibraryVersion"><tt>CGNSLibraryVersion</tt>
          node</a> node mandatory (currently, if it is not present, the
          MLL assumes a default version of 1.05).  The MLL automatically
          adds this node, but other software may not; and then it
          runs into trouble if the MLL is used to read the file
          subsequently. Also, there is the question of a possible need
          for a node referring to the version of the SIDS, as opposed to
          the version of the MLL.  After discussion, it was decided to
          make the current <tt>CGNSLibraryVersion</tt> node mandatory.
          This will be a change in documentation only.  Because the MLL
          and the SIDS keep identical numbering and stay current of each
          other, the number to include is either the MLL library version
          or the SIDS version (they are the exact same number). It was
          decided that a proposal for a separate node for the SIDS
          version number was not crucial at this time, because the
          numbers are identical. The wording "Library" is unfortunate,
          but is difficult to change; the documentation will hopefully
          clarify what is meant. Other issues related to this have
          been brought up on cgnstalk, but it appears possible to work
          within the current framework for the present. Documentation
          needs to be added (in SIDS?) to describe the fact that the
          <tt>CGNSLibraryVersion</tt> node is mandatory &amp; what it
          means, and also documentation is needed somewhere (in MLL
          docs?) to describe how the MLL handles files without the node
          present. <u>Towne will look into where it is most appropriate to
          add documentation regarding this policy.</u>
     </ol>
<br>
<li> Other issues - Rumsey mentioned two mailing lists for other mesh
     standards that are under development (mail
     <a href="mailto:majordomo@ncsa.uiuc.edu">majordomo@ncsa.uiuc.edu</a>;
     subscribe hdf5mesh) (mail
     <a href="mailto:majordomo@mcs.anl.gov">majordomo@mcs.anl.gov</a>;
     subscribe tstt-interface) for those people interested in keeping
     abreast.  There has been some communication with these groups, but
     so far common ground has not been found.  They are aware of CGNS.
<br><br>
<li> Next CGNS meeting will be at the Orlando AIAA Meeting in June -
     anyone is welcome (Tues, June 24 at 7PM in the Jasmine Room).  Next
     Telecon will probably be in Aug-Sept time frame.
<br><br>
<li> Meeting was adjourned at 12:00 PM.
<br><br>
<li> Summary of action items:<br><br>
     <ol type="a">
     <li> Power to report on his group's assessment of HDF-5
          implementation of CGNS.
     <li> Bush (and other volunteers) to review 2 new proposals for
          extension.
     <li> Wedan to add comments to website and/or SourceForge regarding
          policy of "official" release vs. CVS updates.
     <li> Towne to propose documentation regarding
          <tt>CGNSLibraryVersion</tt> node being mandatory - Rumsey will
          involve several people (including Robert Magnan, the person
          who originally pointed out the problem) via e-mail to help
          wordsmith and agree to it.
     <li> Towne to submit latest 2.2 documentation to AIAA to update the
          recommended practice guideline document.
     <li> Wedan to discuss with Poirier the issue of element list and
          element range.
