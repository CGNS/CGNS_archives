<h1>CGNS Steering Committee</h1>

<h2>Meeting Minutes</h2>

12 June 2001<br>
7:00pm<br>
La Jolla Room, Anaheim, CA<br><br>

<p>
The meeting was called to order at 7:00pm.
There were 11 attendees, as <a href="#attendees">listed below</a>.

<p>
The minutes of the 17 May 2001 telecon were approved as posted on the
web.

<ul>
<li> <b>Steering Committee Membership</b> - no activity
<br><br>
<li> <b>Logo</b> - The logo was approved as posted on the web.  Diskettes with
     the art work were made available by Pointwise and distributed to
     Steering Committee members present.  Those wishing a copy of the disk
     can contact Bob Bush or John Chawner.  Members are encouraged to use the
     logo to identify the Standard.
<br><br>
<li> <b>ISO Status</b> - Bob Bush outlined the status of the ISO process.  The
     standard has been assigned the number AP 237 and has been broken into 4
     parts: the Fluid Dynamics standard, CFD, Mesh Based Data, and Product
     data management for analysis.  Drafts of the documents are available
     through the CGNS web site
     (<i>www.cgns.org</i>).
     
     <p>
     At the full CFD Committee on Standards (CoS) meeting, the committee
     voted to offer to serve as the US body for review for the four parts of
     the ISO Standard (based on CGNS).  If accepted by the US governing body
     for the ISO process, the AIAA CFD CoS would offer voting advice to the
     US representative in this area.
     
     <p>
     Those present at the meeting felt that it was important that members of
     this committee familiar with the intent of the CGNS standard
     <b>review the ISO documents</b> before the October meeting. A deadline of 31 August was
     set for this review.  Chris Rumsey and Bob Bush volunteered to review
     the documents.  Steve Legensky volunteered to review the Part on Product
     Data Management.  Those present also suggest and hope that Charlie
     Towne, Diane Poirier, Doug McCarthy and Steve Allmaras will be willing
     to review the ISO documents as well.  Bob Bush will send a request for
     review to these individuals, collect the comments, and reply to Ray
     Cosner.  We encourage anyone else interested in reviewing the documents
     to do so, sending comments to Bush or directly to Cosner.
     
     <p>
     Also at the full CFD Committee on Standards (CoS) meeting, <b>a motion was
     passed to delegate to the CGNS Sub-Committee the authority to serve as
     the consensus body for defining an AIAA Recommended Practice based on
     the CGNS Standard</b>.  After some discussion, the Committee members present
     agreed with this proposal.  Chris Rumsey moved that this committee offer
     to serve as the AIAA Consensus body for defining an AIAA Recommended
     Practice for storing CFD data.  After a second and some discussion, it
     was felt that there was insufficient attendance to formally vote on the
     motion, so Bob Bush will coordinate an e-mail vote of the voting members
     of the Steering Committee.  Those present unanimously recommend a vote
     in favor of the motion.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Software Focal Point</b> - Chris Rumsey reported that NASA Langley was
     moving forward with a small contract to fund Intelligent Light to
     implement the Chemistry, Linking and User Defined Data in the API.  In
     addition, Steve Legensky indicated that Intelligent Light had submitted
     an SBIR proposal to support CGNS in the areas of utilities, performance
     enhancement and adding capabilities.  They hope to know the result of
     this proposal in September, and are recruiting a new person to provide
     this support.
     
     <p>
     Bob Bush indicated that he felt that areas that would benefit from
     near term support included providing broader developer access to the
     code (to enable broader participation for development), Cartesian grid
     support, and the ability to support distributed memory and parallel
     implementations.  Dave Edwards agreed to formulate a team of those
     interested in parallel capabilities in the API.  Interested parties
     include: Boeing St. Louis (Fisher, Michal), Intelligent Light (Edwards),
     NASA Glenn (Iannetti), Stanford (Alonso), AEDC (Nelson) and Pratt &amp;
     Whitney (Bush).
     
     <p>
     Armen Darian indicated that the multi-phase and spray extension still
     needs work, and that he would 'ping' those who have expressed interest.
     
     <p>
     Earlier in the meeting, there was also some discussion of whether
     various implementations are utilizing surface data and boundary data
     correctly for unstructured grid implementations.  This is an issue
     for post processing where the boundary surfaces must be identified to
     provide functionality often desired.  It was also noted that none of
     the examples on the web site utilize the surface boundary condition
     data structures.  Dave Edwards will poll those responsible for various
     implementations and try to generate an example for the web site that
     contains the preferred mode of storing boundary data for unstructured
     grid data sets.
<br><br>
<li> <b>Reno Planning</b> - Dave Edwards indicated that he was collecting
     information on the use of CGNS in industry for a paper to be presented
     at Reno.  He also provided an abstract for the proposed paper entitled
     "CFD General Notation System (CGNS): Status and Future Directions."
     He is also planning a User's Group Meeting as well as the Steering
     Committee Meeting.
</ul>

<p> 
The meeting was adjourned at 8:30pm.
